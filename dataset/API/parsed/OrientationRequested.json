{"name": "Class OrientationRequested", "module": "java.desktop", "package": "javax.print.attribute.standard", "text": "Class OrientationRequested is a printing attribute class, an\n enumeration, that indicates the desired orientation for printed print-stream\n pages; it does not describe the orientation of the client-supplied\n print-stream pages.\n \n For some document formats (such as \"application/postscript\"), the\n desired orientation of the print-stream pages is specified within the\n document data. This information is generated by a device driver prior to the\n submission of the print job. Other document formats (such as\n \"text/plain\") do not include the notion of desired orientation within\n the document data. In the latter case it is possible for the printer to bind\n the desired orientation to the document data after it has been submitted. It\n is expected that a printer would only support the\n OrientationRequested attribute for some document formats (e.g.,\n \"text/plain\" or \"text/html\") but not others (e.g.\n \"application/postscript\"). This is no different from any other job\n template attribute, since a print job can always impose constraints among the\n values of different job template attributes. However, a special mention is\n made here since it is very likely that a printer will support the\n OrientationRequested attribute for only a subset of the supported\n document formats.\n \nIPP Compatibility: The category name returned by getName() is\n the IPP attribute name. The enumeration's integer value is the IPP enum\n value.
