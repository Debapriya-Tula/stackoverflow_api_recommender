{"name": "Interface RenderableImage", "module": "java.desktop", "package": "java.awt.image.renderable", "text": "A RenderableImage is a common interface for rendering-independent\n images (a notion which subsumes resolution independence).  That is,\n images which are described and have operations applied to them\n independent of any specific rendering of the image.  For example, a\n RenderableImage can be rotated and cropped in\n resolution-independent terms.  Then, it can be rendered for various\n specific contexts, such as a draft preview, a high-quality screen\n display, or a printer, each in an optimal fashion.\n\n  A RenderedImage is returned from a RenderableImage via the\n createRendering() method, which takes a RenderContext.  The\n RenderContext specifies how the RenderedImage should be\n constructed.  Note that it is not possible to extract pixels\n directly from a RenderableImage.\n\n  The createDefaultRendering() and createScaledRendering() methods are\n convenience methods that construct an appropriate RenderContext\n internally.
