{"name": "Interface SQLInput", "module": "java.sql", "package": "java.sql", "text": "An input stream that contains a stream of values representing an\n instance of an SQL structured type or an SQL distinct type.\n This interface, used only for custom mapping, is used by the driver\n behind the scenes, and a programmer never directly invokes\n SQLInput methods. The reader methods\n (readLong, readBytes, and so on)\n provide a way  for an implementation of the SQLData\n  interface to read the values in an SQLInput object.\n  And as described in SQLData, calls to reader methods must\n be made in the order that their corresponding attributes appear in the\n SQL definition of the type.\n The method wasNull is used to determine whether\n the last value read was SQL NULL.\n When the method getObject is called with an\n object of a class implementing the interface SQLData,\n the JDBC driver calls the method SQLData.getSQLType\n to determine the SQL type of the user-defined type (UDT)\n being custom mapped. The driver\n creates an instance of SQLInput, populating it with the\n attributes of the UDT.  The driver then passes the input\n stream to the method SQLData.readSQL, which in turn\n calls the SQLInput reader methods\n in its implementation for reading the\n attributes from the input stream.", "codes": ["public interface SQLInput"], "fields": [], "methods": [{"method_name": "readString", "method_sig": "String readString()\n           throws SQLException", "description": "Reads the next attribute in the stream and returns it as a String\n in the Java programming language."}, {"method_name": "readBoolean", "method_sig": "boolean readBoolean()\n             throws SQLException", "description": "Reads the next attribute in the stream and returns it as a boolean\n in the Java programming language."}, {"method_name": "readByte", "method_sig": "byte readByte()\n       throws SQLException", "description": "Reads the next attribute in the stream and returns it as a byte\n in the Java programming language."}, {"method_name": "readShort", "method_sig": "short readShort()\n         throws SQLException", "description": "Reads the next attribute in the stream and returns it as a short\n in the Java programming language."}, {"method_name": "readInt", "method_sig": "int readInt()\n     throws SQLException", "description": "Reads the next attribute in the stream and returns it as an int\n in the Java programming language."}, {"method_name": "readLong", "method_sig": "long readLong()\n       throws SQLException", "description": "Reads the next attribute in the stream and returns it as a long\n in the Java programming language."}, {"method_name": "readFloat", "method_sig": "float readFloat()\n         throws SQLException", "description": "Reads the next attribute in the stream and returns it as a float\n in the Java programming language."}, {"method_name": "readDouble", "method_sig": "double readDouble()\n           throws SQLException", "description": "Reads the next attribute in the stream and returns it as a double\n in the Java programming language."}, {"method_name": "readBigDecimal", "method_sig": "BigDecimal readBigDecimal()\n                   throws SQLException", "description": "Reads the next attribute in the stream and returns it as a java.math.BigDecimal\n object in the Java programming language."}, {"method_name": "readBytes", "method_sig": "byte[] readBytes()\n          throws SQLException", "description": "Reads the next attribute in the stream and returns it as an array of bytes\n in the Java programming language."}, {"method_name": "readDate", "method_sig": "Date readDate()\n       throws SQLException", "description": "Reads the next attribute in the stream and returns it as a java.sql.Date object."}, {"method_name": "readTime", "method_sig": "Time readTime()\n       throws SQLException", "description": "Reads the next attribute in the stream and returns it as a java.sql.Time object."}, {"method_name": "readTimestamp", "method_sig": "Timestamp readTimestamp()\n                 throws SQLException", "description": "Reads the next attribute in the stream and returns it as a java.sql.Timestamp object."}, {"method_name": "readCharacterStream", "method_sig": "Reader readCharacterStream()\n                    throws SQLException", "description": "Reads the next attribute in the stream and returns it as a stream of Unicode characters."}, {"method_name": "readAsciiStream", "method_sig": "InputStream readAsciiStream()\n                     throws SQLException", "description": "Reads the next attribute in the stream and returns it as a stream of ASCII characters."}, {"method_name": "readBinaryStream", "method_sig": "InputStream readBinaryStream()\n                      throws SQLException", "description": "Reads the next attribute in the stream and returns it as a stream of uninterpreted\n bytes."}, {"method_name": "readObject", "method_sig": "Object readObject()\n           throws SQLException", "description": "Reads the datum at the head of the stream and returns it as an\n Object in the Java programming language.
