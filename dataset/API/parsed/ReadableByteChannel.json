Upon return the buffer's position will be equal to\n p\u00a0+\u00a0n; its limit will not have changed.\n\n  A read operation might not fill the buffer, and in fact it might not\n read any bytes at all.  Whether or not it does so depends upon the\n nature and state of the channel.  A socket channel in non-blocking mode,\n for example, cannot read any more bytes than are immediately available\n from the socket's input buffer; similarly, a file channel cannot read\n any more bytes than remain in the file.  It is guaranteed, however, that\n if a channel is in blocking mode and there is at least one byte\n remaining in the buffer then this method will block until at least one\n byte is read.\n\n  This method may be invoked at any time.  If another thread has\n already initiated a read operation upon this channel, however, then an\n invocation of this method will block until the first operation is\n complete. "}]}
