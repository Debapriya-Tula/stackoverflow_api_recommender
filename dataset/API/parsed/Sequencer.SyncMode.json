{"name": "Class Sequencer.SyncMode", "module": "java.desktop", "package": "javax.sound.midi", "text": "A SyncMode object represents one of the ways in which a MIDI\n sequencer's notion of time can be synchronized with a master or slave\n device. If the sequencer is being synchronized to a master, the sequencer\n revises its current time in response to messages from the master. If the\n sequencer has a slave, the sequencer similarly sends messages to control\n the slave's timing.\n \n There are three predefined modes that specify possible masters for a\n sequencer: INTERNAL_CLOCK, MIDI_SYNC, and\n MIDI_TIME_CODE. The latter two work if the sequencer receives\n MIDI messages from another device. In these two modes, the sequencer's\n time gets reset based on system real-time timing clock messages or MIDI\n time code (MTC) messages, respectively. These two modes can also be used\n as slave modes, in which case the sequencer sends the corresponding types\n of MIDI messages to its receiver (whether or not the sequencer is also\n receiving them from a master). A fourth mode, NO_SYNC, is used to\n indicate that the sequencer should not control its receiver's timing.", "codes": ["public static class Sequencer.SyncMode\nextends Object"], "fields": [{"field_name": "INTERNAL_CLOCK", "field_sig": "public static final\u00a0Sequencer.SyncMode INTERNAL_CLOCK", "description": "A master synchronization mode that makes the sequencer get its timing\n information from its internal clock.
