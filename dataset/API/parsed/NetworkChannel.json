The bind method is used to bind the\n socket to a local address, the getLocalAddress method returns the address that the socket is bound to, and\n the setOption and getOption methods are used to set and query socket\n options.  An implementation of this interface should specify the socket options\n that it supports.\n\n  The bind and setOption methods that do\n not otherwise have a value to return are specified to return the network\n channel upon which they are invoked.
