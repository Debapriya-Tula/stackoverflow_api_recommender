{"name": "Class PrinterStateReason", "module": "java.desktop", "package": "javax.print.attribute.standard", "text": "Class PrinterStateReason is a printing attribute class, an\n enumeration, that provides additional information about the printer's current\n state, i.e., information that augments the value of the printer's\n PrinterState attribute. Class PrinterStateReason defines\n standard printer state reason values. A Print Service implementation only\n needs to report those printer state reasons which are appropriate for the\n particular implementation; it does not have to report every defined printer\n state reason.\n \n Instances of PrinterStateReason do not appear in a Print Service's\n attribute set directly. Rather, a\n PrinterStateReasons attribute appears in the\n Print Service's attribute set. The\n PrinterStateReasons attribute contains zero, one,\n or more than one PrinterStateReason objects which pertain to the\n Print Service's status, and each PrinterStateReason object is associated with\n a Severity level of REPORT (least severe),\n WARNING, or ERROR (most severe). The printer adds a\n PrinterStateReason object to the Print Service's\n PrinterStateReasons attribute when the\n corresponding condition becomes true of the printer, and the printer removes\n the PrinterStateReason object again when the corresponding condition\n becomes false, regardless of whether the Print Service's overall\n PrinterState also changed.\n \nIPP Compatibility: The string values returned by each individual\n PrinterStateReason and associated Severity object's\n toString() methods, concatenated together with a hyphen (\"-\")\n in between, gives the IPP keyword value for a PrinterStateReasons.\n The category name returned by getName() gives the IPP attribute name.", "codes": ["public class PrinterStateReason\nextends EnumSyntax\nimplements Attribute"], "fields": [{"field_name": "OTHER", "field_sig": "public static final\u00a0PrinterStateReason OTHER", "description": "The printer has detected an error other than ones listed below."}, {"field_name": "MEDIA_NEEDED", "field_sig": "public static final\u00a0PrinterStateReason MEDIA_NEEDED", "description": "A tray has run out of media."}, {"field_name": "MEDIA_JAM", "field_sig": "public static final\u00a0PrinterStateReason MEDIA_JAM", "description": "The device has a media jam."}, {"field_name": "MOVING_TO_PAUSED", "field_sig": "public static final\u00a0PrinterStateReason MOVING_TO_PAUSED", "description": "Someone has paused the printer, but the device(s) are taking an\n appreciable time to stop.
