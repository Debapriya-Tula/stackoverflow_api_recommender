Otherwise, it is dispatched to a separate\n composition window.\n\n \n The text included with the input method event consists of two parts:\n committed text and composed text. Either part may be empty. The two\n parts together replace any uncommitted composed text sent in previous events,\n or the currently selected committed text.\n Committed text should be integrated into the text component's persistent\n data, it will not be sent again. Composed text may be sent repeatedly,\n with changes to reflect the user's editing operations.
