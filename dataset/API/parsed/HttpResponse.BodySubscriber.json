{"name": "Interface HttpResponse.BodySubscriber<T>", "module": "java.net.http", "package": "java.net.http", "text": "A BodySubscriber consumes response body bytes and converts them\n into a higher-level Java type.  The class BodySubscriber provides implementations of many common body subscribers.\n\n  The object acts as a Flow.Subscriber<List<ByteBuffer>> to the HTTP Client implementation, which publishes\n lists of ByteBuffers containing the response body. The Flow of data, as\n well as the order of ByteBuffers in the Flow lists, is a strictly ordered\n representation of the response body. Both the Lists and the ByteBuffers,\n once passed to the subscriber, are no longer used by the HTTP Client. The\n subscriber converts the incoming buffers of data to some higher-level\n Java type T.\n\n  The getBody() method returns a\n CompletionStage<T> that provides the response body\n object. The CompletionStage must be obtainable at any time. When\n it completes depends on the nature of type T. In many cases,\n when T represents the entire body after being consumed then\n the CompletionStage completes after the body has been consumed.\n If  T is a streaming type, such as InputStream, then it completes before the body has been read, because\n the calling code uses the InputStream to consume the data.", "codes": ["public static interface HttpResponse.BodySubscriber<T>\nextends Flow.Subscriber<List<ByteBuffer>>"], "fields": [], "methods": [{"method_name": "getBody", "method_sig": "CompletionStage<T> getBody()", "description": "Returns a CompletionStage which when completed will return\n the response body object.
