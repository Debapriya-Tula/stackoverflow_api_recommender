{"name": "Class GlyphJustificationInfo", "module": "java.desktop", "package": "java.awt.font", "text": "The GlyphJustificationInfo class represents information\n about the justification properties of a glyph.  A glyph is the visual\n representation of one or more characters.  Many different glyphs can\n be used to represent a single character or combination of characters.\n The four justification properties represented by\n GlyphJustificationInfo are weight, priority, absorb and\n limit.\n \n Weight is the overall 'weight' of the glyph in the line.  Generally it is\n proportional to the size of the font.  Glyphs with larger weight are\n allocated a correspondingly larger amount of the change in space.\n \n Priority determines the justification phase in which this glyph is used.\n All glyphs of the same priority are examined before glyphs of the next\n priority.  If all the change in space can be allocated to these glyphs\n without exceeding their limits, then glyphs of the next priority are not\n examined. There are four priorities, kashida, whitespace, interchar,\n and none.  KASHIDA is the first priority examined. NONE is the last\n priority examined.\n \n Absorb determines whether a glyph absorbs all change in space.  Within a\n given priority, some glyphs may absorb all the change in space.  If any of\n these glyphs are present, no glyphs of later priority are examined.\n \n Limit determines the maximum or minimum amount by which the glyph can\n change. Left and right sides of the glyph can have different limits.\n \n Each GlyphJustificationInfo represents two sets of\n metrics, which are growing and shrinking.  Growing\n metrics are used when the glyphs on a line are to be\n spread apart to fit a larger width.  Shrinking metrics are used when\n the glyphs are to be moved together to fit a smaller width.", "codes": ["public final class GlyphJustificationInfo\nextends Object"], "fields": [{"field_name": "PRIORITY_KASHIDA", "field_sig": "public static final\u00a0int PRIORITY_KASHIDA", "description": "The highest justification priority."}, {"field_name": "PRIORITY_WHITESPACE", "field_sig": "public static final\u00a0int PRIORITY_WHITESPACE", "description": "The second highest justification priority."}, {"field_name": "PRIORITY_INTERCHAR", "field_sig": "public static final\u00a0int PRIORITY_INTERCHAR", "description": "The second lowest justification priority."}, {"field_name": "PRIORITY_NONE", "field_sig": "public static final\u00a0int PRIORITY_NONE", "description": "The lowest justification priority."}, {"field_name": "weight", "field_sig": "public final\u00a0float weight", "description": "The weight of this glyph."}, {"field_name": "growPriority", "field_sig": "public final\u00a0int growPriority", "description": "The priority level of this glyph as it is growing."}, {"field_name": "growAbsorb", "field_sig": "public final\u00a0boolean growAbsorb", "description": "If true, this glyph absorbs all extra\n space at this and lower priority levels when it grows."}, {"field_name": "growLeftLimit", "field_sig": "public final\u00a0float growLeftLimit", "description": "The maximum amount by which the left side of this glyph can grow."}, {"field_name": "growRightLimit", "field_sig": "public final\u00a0float growRightLimit", "description": "The maximum amount by which the right side of this glyph can grow."}, {"field_name": "shrinkPriority", "field_sig": "public final\u00a0int shrinkPriority", "description": "The priority level of this glyph as it is shrinking."}, {"field_name": "shrinkAbsorb", "field_sig": "public final\u00a0boolean shrinkAbsorb", "description": "If true,this glyph absorbs all remaining shrinkage at\n this and lower priority levels as it shrinks."}, {"field_name": "shrinkLeftLimit", "field_sig": "public final\u00a0float shrinkLeftLimit", "description": "The maximum amount by which the left side of this glyph can shrink\n (a positive number)."}, {"field_name": "shrinkRightLimit", "field_sig": "public final\u00a0float shrinkRightLimit", "description": "The maximum amount by which the right side of this glyph can shrink\n (a positive number)."}], "methods": []}
