{"name": "Class MulticastSocket", "module": "java.base", "package": "java.net", "text": "The multicast datagram socket class is useful for sending\n and receiving IP multicast packets.  A MulticastSocket is\n a (UDP) DatagramSocket, with additional capabilities for\n joining \"groups\" of other multicast hosts on the internet.\n \n A multicast group is specified by a class D IP address\n and by a standard UDP port number. Class D IP addresses\n are in the range 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255,\n inclusive. The address 224.0.0.0 is reserved and should not be used.\n \n One would join a multicast group by first creating a MulticastSocket\n with the desired port, then invoking the\n joinGroup(InetAddress groupAddr)\n method:\n \n // join a Multicast group and send the group salutations\n ...\n String msg = \"Hello\";\n InetAddress group = InetAddress.getByName(\"228.5.6.7\");\n MulticastSocket s = new MulticastSocket(6789);\n s.joinGroup(group);\n DatagramPacket hi = new DatagramPacket(msg.getBytes(), msg.length(),\n                             group, 6789);\n s.send(hi);\n // get their responses!\n byte[] buf = new byte[1000];\n DatagramPacket recv = new DatagramPacket(buf, buf.length);\n s.receive(recv);\n ...\n // OK, I'm done talking - leave the group...\n s.leaveGroup(group);\n \n\n When one sends a message to a multicast group, all subscribing\n recipients to that host and port receive the message (within the\n time-to-live range of the packet, see below).  The socket needn't\n be a member of the multicast group to send messages to it.\n \n When a socket subscribes to a multicast group/port, it receives\n datagrams sent by other hosts to the group/port, as do all other\n members of the group and port.  A socket relinquishes membership\n in a group by the leaveGroup(InetAddress addr) method.  \n Multiple MulticastSocket's may subscribe to a multicast group\n and port concurrently, and they will all receive group datagrams.\n \n Currently applets are not allowed to use multicast sockets.", "codes": ["public class MulticastSocket\nextends DatagramSocket"], "fields": [], "methods": [{"method_name": "setTTL", "method_sig": "@Deprecated\npublic void setTTL (byte ttl)\n            throws IOException", "description": "Set the default time-to-live for multicast packets sent out\n on this MulticastSocket in order to control the\n scope of the multicasts.\n\n The ttl is an unsigned 8-bit quantity, and so must be\n in the range 0 <= ttl <= 0xFF ."}, {"method_name": "setTimeToLive", "method_sig": "public void setTimeToLive (int ttl)\n                   throws IOException", "description": "Set the default time-to-live for multicast packets sent out\n on this MulticastSocket in order to control the\n scope of the multicasts.\n\n  The ttl must be in the range  0 <= ttl <=\n 255 or an IllegalArgumentException will be thrown.\n Multicast packets sent with a TTL of 0 are not transmitted\n on the network but may be delivered locally."}, {"method_name": "getTTL", "method_sig": "@Deprecated\npublic byte getTTL()\n            throws IOException", "description": "Get the default time-to-live for multicast packets sent out on\n the socket."}, {"method_name": "getTimeToLive", "method_sig": "public int getTimeToLive()\n                  throws IOException", "description": "Get the default time-to-live for multicast packets sent out on\n the socket."}, {"method_name": "joinGroup", "method_sig": "public void joinGroup (InetAddress mcastaddr)\n               throws IOException", "description": "Joins a multicast group.
