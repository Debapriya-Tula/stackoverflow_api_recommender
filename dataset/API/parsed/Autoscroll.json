This feature is known as autoscrolling.\n \n If a GUI control is both an active DropTarget\n and is also scrollable, it\n can receive notifications of autoscrolling gestures by the user from\n the DnD system by implementing this interface.\n \n An autoscrolling gesture is initiated by the user by keeping the drag\n cursor motionless with a border region of the Component,\n referred to as\n the \"autoscrolling region\", for a predefined period of time, this will\n result in repeated scroll requests to the Component\n until the drag Cursor resumes its motion.", "codes": ["public interface Autoscroll"], "fields": [], "methods": [{"method_name": "getAutoscrollInsets", "method_sig": "Insets getAutoscrollInsets()", "description": "This method returns the Insets describing\n the autoscrolling region or border relative\n to the geometry of the implementing Component.\n \n This value is read once by the DropTarget\n upon entry of the drag Cursor\n into the associated Component."}, {"method_name": "autoscroll", "method_sig": "void autoscroll (Point cursorLocn)", "description": "notify the Component to autoscroll"}]}
