ByteLookupTable\n and ShortLookupTable are subclasses, which\n contain byte and short data, respectively.  A lookup table\n contains data arrays for one or more bands (or components) of an image\n (for example, separate arrays for R, G, and B),\n and it contains an offset which will be subtracted from the\n input values before indexing into the arrays.  This allows an array\n smaller than the native data size to be provided for a\n constrained input.  If there is only one array in the lookup\n table, it will be applied to all bands.  All arrays must be the\n same size.", "codes": ["public abstract class LookupTable\nextends Object"], "fields": [], "methods": [{"method_name": "getNumComponents", "method_sig": "public int getNumComponents()", "description": "Returns the number of components in the lookup table."}, {"method_name": "getOffset", "method_sig": "public int getOffset()", "description": "Returns the offset."}, {"method_name": "lookupPixel", "method_sig": "public abstract int[] lookupPixel (int[] src,\n                                  int[] dest)", "description": "Returns an int array of components for\n one pixel.
