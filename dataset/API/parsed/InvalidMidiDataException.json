This often means that the data is invalid in and of itself,\n from the perspective of the MIDI specification. An example would be an\n undefined status byte. However, the exception might simply mean that the data\n was invalid in the context it was used, or that the object to which the data\n was given was unable to parse or use it. For example, a file reader might not\n be able to parse a Type 2 MIDI file, even though that format is defined in\n the MIDI specification.", "codes": ["public class InvalidMidiDataException\nextends Exception"], "fields": [], "methods": []}
