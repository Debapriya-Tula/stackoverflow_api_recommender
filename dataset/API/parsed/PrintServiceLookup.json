{"name": "Class PrintServiceLookup", "module": "java.desktop", "package": "javax.print", "text": "Implementations of this class provide lookup services for print services\n (typically equivalent to printers) of a particular type.\n \n Multiple implementations may be installed concurrently. All implementations\n must be able to describe the located printers as instances of a\n PrintService. Typically implementations of this service class are\n located automatically in JAR files (see the SPI JAR file specification).\n These classes must be instantiable using a default constructor. Alternatively\n applications may explicitly register instances at runtime.\n \n Applications use only the static methods of this abstract class. The instance\n methods are implemented by a service provider in a subclass and the\n unification of the results from all installed lookup classes are reported by\n the static methods of this class when called by the application.\n \n A PrintServiceLookup implementor is recommended to check for the\n SecurityManager.checkPrintJobAccess() to deny access to untrusted\n code. Following this recommended policy means that untrusted code may not be\n able to locate any print services. Downloaded applets are the most common\n example of untrusted code.\n \n This check is made on a per lookup service basis to allow flexibility in the\n policy to reflect the needs of different lookup services.\n \n Services which are registered by registerService(PrintService) will\n not be included in lookup results if a security manager is installed and its\n checkPrintJobAccess() method denies access.", "codes": ["public abstract class PrintServiceLookup\nextends Object"], "fields": [], "methods": [{"method_name": "lookupPrintServices", "method_sig": "public static final PrintService[] lookupPrintServices (DocFlavor flavor,\n                                                       AttributeSet attributes)", "description": "Locates print services capable of printing the specified\n DocFlavor."}, {"method_name": "lookupMultiDocPrintServices", "method_sig": "public static final MultiDocPrintService[] lookupMultiDocPrintServices (DocFlavor[] flavors,\n                                                                       AttributeSet attributes)", "description": "Locates MultiDoc print Services capable of printing\n MultiDocs containing all the specified doc flavors.\n \n This method is useful to help locate a service that can print a\n MultiDoc in which the elements may be different flavors.
