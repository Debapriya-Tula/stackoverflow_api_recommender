This abstract class defines null methods for them\n all, so you can only have to define methods for events you care about.)\n \n Create a listener object using the extended class and then register it with\n a component using the component's addFocusListener\n method. When the component gains or loses the keyboard focus,\n the relevant method in the listener object is invoked,\n and the FocusEvent is passed to it.", "codes": ["public abstract class FocusAdapter\nextends Object\nimplements FocusListener"], "fields": [], "methods": [{"method_name": "focusGained", "method_sig": "public void focusGained (FocusEvent e)", "description": "Invoked when a component gains the keyboard focus."}, {"method_name": "focusLost", "method_sig": "public void focusLost (FocusEvent e)", "description": "Invoked when a component loses the keyboard focus."}]}
