Typically this would be done by a server that wants to\n impersonate a client thread at the Java level by setting a client\n Subject in the current access control context. If the server is merely\n interested in using a principal based policy in its local JVM, then\n it only needs to provide the GSSName of the client.\n\n The elements from the GSSName are placed in the principals set of this\n Subject and those from the GSSCredential are placed in the private\n credentials set of the Subject. Any Kerberos specific elements that\n are added to the subject will be instances of the standard Kerberos\n implementation classes defined in javax.security.auth.kerberos."}]}
