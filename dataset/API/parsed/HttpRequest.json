An HttpRequest builder\n is obtained from one of the newBuilder\n methods. A request's URI, headers, and body can be set. Request\n bodies are provided through a BodyPublisher supplied\n to one of the POST,\n PUT or\n method methods.\n Once all required parameters have been set in the builder, build will return the HttpRequest. Builders can be\n copied and modified many times in order to build multiple related requests\n that differ in some parameters.\n\n  The following is an example of a GET request that prints the response\n body as a String:\n\n    HttpClient client = HttpClient.newHttpClient();\n   HttpRequest request = HttpRequest.newBuilder()\n         .uri(URI.create(\"http://foo.com/\"))\n         .build();\n   client.sendAsync(request, BodyHandlers.ofString())\n         .thenApply(HttpResponse::body)\n         .thenAccept(System.out::println)\n         .join(); \nThe class BodyPublishers provides implementations\n of many common publishers.
