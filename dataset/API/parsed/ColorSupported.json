{"name": "Class ColorSupported", "module": "java.desktop", "package": "javax.print.attribute.standard", "text": "Class ColorSupported is a printing attribute class, an enumeration,\n that identifies whether the device is capable of any type of color printing\n at all, including highlight color as well as full process color. All document\n instructions having to do with color are embedded within the print data (none\n are attributes attached to the job outside the print data).\n \n Note: End users are able to determine the nature and details of the color\n support by querying the\n PrinterMoreInfoManufacturer attribute.\n \n Don't confuse the ColorSupported attribute with the\n Chromaticity attribute.\n Chromaticity is an attribute the client can specify for\n a job to tell the printer whether to print a document in monochrome or color,\n possibly causing the printer to print a color document in monochrome.\n ColorSupported is a printer description attribute that tells whether\n the printer can print in color regardless of how the client specifies to\n print any particular document.\n \nIPP Compatibility: The IPP boolean value is \"true\" for SUPPORTED and\n \"false\" for NOT_SUPPORTED. The category name returned by getName() is\n the IPP attribute name. The enumeration's integer value is the IPP enum\n value.
