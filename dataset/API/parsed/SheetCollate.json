{"name": "Class SheetCollate", "module": "java.desktop", "package": "javax.print.attribute.standard", "text": "Class SheetCollate is a printing attribute class, an enumeration,\n that specifies whether or not the media sheets of each copy of each printed\n document in a job are to be in sequence, when multiple copies of the document\n are specified by the Copies attribute. When\n SheetCollate is COLLATED, each copy of each document is\n printed with the print-stream sheets in sequence. When SheetCollate\n is UNCOLLATED, each print-stream sheet is printed a number of times\n equal to the value of the Copies attribute in succession. For\n example, suppose a document produces two media sheets as output,\n Copies is 6, and SheetCollate is UNCOLLATED; in this\n case six copies of the first media sheet are printed followed by six copies\n of the second media sheet.\n \n Whether the effect of sheet collation is achieved by placing copies of a\n document in multiple output bins or in the same output bin with\n implementation defined document separation is implementation dependent. Also\n whether it is achieved by making multiple passes over the job or by using an\n output sorter is implementation dependent.\n \n If a printer does not support the SheetCollate attribute (meaning the\n client cannot specify any particular sheet collation), the printer must\n behave as though SheetCollate were always set to COLLATED.\n \n The SheetCollate attribute interacts with the\n MultipleDocumentHandling attribute. The\n MultipleDocumentHandling attribute describes\n the collation of entire documents, and the SheetCollate attribute\n describes the semantics of collating individual pages within a document.\n \n The effect of a SheetCollate attribute on a multidoc print job (a job\n with multiple documents) depends on whether all the docs have the same sheet\n collation specified or whether different docs have different sheet collations\n specified, and on the (perhaps defaulted) value of the\n MultipleDocumentHandling attribute.\n \nIf all the docs have the same sheet collation specified, then the\n   following combinations of SheetCollate and\n   MultipleDocumentHandling are permitted,\n   and the printer reports an error when the job is submitted if any other\n   combination is specified:\n   \nSheetCollate = COLLATED, MultipleDocumentHandling = SINGLE_DOCUMENT -- All the input docs will be\n     combined into one output document.
