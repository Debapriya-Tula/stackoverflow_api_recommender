Descriptors have been\n added on the meta data objects.\n \n Java resources wishing to be manageable instantiate the ModelMBean using the\n MBeanServer's createMBean method.  The resource then sets the ModelMBeanInfo\n and Descriptors for the ModelMBean instance. The attributes and operations\n exposed via the ModelMBeanInfo for the ModelMBean are accessible\n from MBeans, connectors/adaptors like other MBeans. Through the Descriptors,\n values and methods in the managed application can be defined and mapped to\n attributes and operations of the ModelMBean.\n This mapping can be defined during development in a file or dynamically and\n programmatically at runtime.\n \n Every ModelMBean which is instantiated in the MBeanServer becomes manageable:\n its attributes and operations\n become remotely accessible through the connectors/adaptors connected to that\n MBeanServer.\n A Java object cannot be registered in the MBeanServer unless it is a JMX\n compliant MBean.\n By instantiating a ModelMBean, resources are guaranteed that the MBean is\n valid.\n\n MBeanException and RuntimeOperationsException must be thrown on every public\n method.  This allows for wrapping exceptions from distributed\n communications (RMI, EJB, etc.)\n\n The serialVersionUID of this class is\n -1935722590756516193L.", "codes": ["public class ModelMBeanInfoSupport\nextends MBeanInfo\nimplements ModelMBeanInfo"], "fields": [], "methods": [{"method_name": "clone", "method_sig": "public Object clone()", "description": "Returns a shallow clone of this instance.
