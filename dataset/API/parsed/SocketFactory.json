{"name": "Class SocketFactory", "module": "java.base", "package": "javax.net", "text": "This class creates sockets.  It may be subclassed by other factories,\n which create particular subclasses of sockets and thus provide a general\n framework for the addition of public socket-level functionality.\n\n  Socket factories are a simple way to capture a variety of policies\n related to the sockets being constructed, producing such sockets in\n a way which does not require special configuration of the code which\n asks for the sockets:  \n Due to polymorphism of both factories and sockets, different\n      kinds of sockets can be used by the same application code just\n      by passing it different kinds of factories.\n\n       Factories can themselves be customized with parameters used\n      in socket construction.  So for example, factories could be\n      customized to return sockets with different networking timeouts\n      or security parameters already configured.\n\n       The sockets returned to the application can be subclasses\n      of java.net.Socket, so that they can directly expose new APIs\n      for features such as compression, security, record marking,\n      statistics collection, or firewall tunneling.\n\n      \n Factory classes are specified by environment-specific configuration\n mechanisms.  For example, the getDefault method could return\n a factory that was appropriate for a particular user or applet, and a\n framework could use a factory customized to its own purposes.", "codes": ["public abstract class SocketFactory\nextends Object"], "fields": [], "methods": [{"method_name": "getDefault", "method_sig": "public static SocketFactory getDefault()", "description": "Returns a copy of the environment's default socket factory."}, {"method_name": "createSocket", "method_sig": "public Socket createSocket()\n                    throws IOException", "description": "Creates an unconnected socket."}, {"method_name": "createSocket", "method_sig": "public abstract Socket createSocket (String host,\n                                    int port)\n                             throws IOException,\n                                    UnknownHostException", "description": "Creates a socket and connects it to the specified remote host\n at the specified remote port.
