{"name": "Class InheritableThreadLocal<T>", "module": "java.base", "package": "java.lang", "text": "This class extends ThreadLocal to provide inheritance of values\n from parent thread to child thread: when a child thread is created, the\n child receives initial values for all inheritable thread-local variables\n for which the parent has values.  Normally the child's values will be\n identical to the parent's; however, the child's value can be made an\n arbitrary function of the parent's by overriding the childValue\n method in this class.\n\n Inheritable thread-local variables are used in preference to\n ordinary thread-local variables when the per-thread-attribute being\n maintained in the variable (e.g., User ID, Transaction ID) must be\n automatically transmitted to any child threads that are created.\n\n Note: During the creation of a new thread, it is\n possible to opt out of receiving initial values for inheritable\n thread-local variables.", "codes": ["public class InheritableThreadLocal<T>\nextends ThreadLocal<T>"], "fields": [], "methods": [{"method_name": "childValue", "method_sig": "protected T childValue (T parentValue)", "description": "Computes the child's initial value for this inheritable thread-local\n variable as a function of the parent's value at the time the child\n thread is created.
