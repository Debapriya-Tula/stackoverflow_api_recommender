{"name": "Class CallSiteDescriptor", "module": "jdk.dynalink", "package": "jdk.dynalink", "text": "Call site descriptors contain all the information necessary for linking a\n call site. This information is normally passed as parameters to bootstrap\n methods and consists of the MethodHandles.Lookup object on the caller\n class in which the call site occurs, the dynamic operation at the call\n site, and the method type of the call site. CallSiteDescriptor\n objects are used in Dynalink to capture and store these parameters for\n subsequent use by the DynamicLinker.\n \n The constructors of built-in RelinkableCallSite implementations all\n take a call site descriptor.\n \n Call site descriptors must be immutable. You can use this class as-is or you\n can subclass it, especially if you need to add further information to the\n descriptors (typically, values passed in additional parameters to the\n bootstrap method. Since the descriptors must be immutable, you can set up a\n cache for equivalent descriptors to have the call sites share them.\n \n The class extends SecureLookupSupplier for security-checked access to\n the MethodHandles.Lookup object it carries.
