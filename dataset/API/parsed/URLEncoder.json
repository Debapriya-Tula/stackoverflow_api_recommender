{"name": "Class URLEncoder", "module": "java.base", "package": "java.net", "text": "Utility class for HTML form encoding. This class contains static methods\n for converting a String to the application/x-www-form-urlencoded MIME\n format. For more information about HTML form encoding, consult the HTML\n specification.\n\n \n When encoding a String, the following rules apply:\n\n \nThe alphanumeric characters \"a\" through\n     \"z\", \"A\" through\n     \"Z\" and \"0\"\n     through \"9\" remain the same.\n The special characters \".\",\n     \"-\", \"*\", and\n     \"_\" remain the same.\n The space character \" \u00a0 \" is\n     converted into a plus sign \"+\".\n All other characters are unsafe and are first converted into\n     one or more bytes using some encoding scheme. Then each byte is\n     represented by the 3-character string\n     \"%xy\", where xy is the\n     two-digit hexadecimal representation of the byte.\n     The recommended encoding scheme to use is UTF-8. However,\n     for compatibility reasons, if an encoding is not specified,\n     then the default encoding of the platform is used.\n \n\n For example using UTF-8 as the encoding scheme the string \"The\n string \u00fc@foo-bar\" would get converted to\n \"The+string+%C3%BC%40foo-bar\" because in UTF-8 the character\n \u00fc is encoded as two bytes C3 (hex) and BC (hex), and the\n character @ is encoded as one byte 40 (hex).", "codes": ["public class URLEncoder\nextends Object"], "fields": [], "methods": [{"method_name": "encode", "method_sig": "@Deprecated\npublic static String encode (String s)", "description": "Translates a string into x-www-form-urlencoded\n format.
