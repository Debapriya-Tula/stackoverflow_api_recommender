{"name": "Class Event", "module": "java.desktop", "package": "java.awt", "text": "NOTE: The Event class is obsolete and is\n available only for backwards compatibility.  It has been replaced\n by the AWTEvent class and its subclasses.\n \nEvent is a platform-independent class that\n encapsulates events from the platform's Graphical User\n Interface in the Java\u00a01.0 event model. In Java\u00a01.1\n and later versions, the Event class is maintained\n only for backwards compatibility. The information in this\n class description is provided to assist programmers in\n converting Java\u00a01.0 programs to the new event model.\n \n In the Java\u00a01.0 event model, an event contains an\n id field\n that indicates what type of event it is and which other\n Event variables are relevant for the event.\n \n For keyboard events, key\n contains a value indicating which key was activated, and\n modifiers contains the\n modifiers for that event.  For the KEY_PRESS and KEY_RELEASE\n event ids, the value of key is the unicode\n character code for the key. For KEY_ACTION and\n KEY_ACTION_RELEASE, the value of key is\n one of the defined action-key identifiers in the\n Event class (PGUP,\n PGDN, F1, F2, etc).", "codes": ["@Deprecated(since=\"9\")\npublic class Event\nextends Object\nimplements Serializable"], "fields": [{"field_name": "SHIFT_MASK", "field_sig": "public static final\u00a0int SHIFT_MASK", "description": "This flag indicates that the Shift key was down when the event\n occurred."}, {"field_name": "CTRL_MASK", "field_sig": "public static final\u00a0int CTRL_MASK", "description": "This flag indicates that the Control key was down when the event\n occurred."}, {"field_name": "META_MASK", "field_sig": "public static final\u00a0int META_MASK", "description": "This flag indicates that the Meta key was down when the event\n occurred.
