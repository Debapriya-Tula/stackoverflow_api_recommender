A requesting user name is an arbitrary string defined by the client. The\n printer does not put the client-specified RequestingUserName\n attribute into the Print Job's attribute set; rather, the printer puts in a\n JobOriginatingUserName attribute. This means\n that services which support specifying a username with this attribute should\n also report a JobOriginatingUserName in the job's attribute set. Note\n that many print services may have a way to independently authenticate the\n user name, and so may state support for a requesting user name, but in\n practice will then report the user name authenticated by the service rather\n than that specified via this attribute.\n \nIPP Compatibility: The string value gives the IPP name value. The\n locale gives the IPP natural language.
