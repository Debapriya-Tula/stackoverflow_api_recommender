A mouse wheel event is generated when the mouse wheel is rotated.\n When a mouse wheel event occurs, that object's mouseWheelMoved\n method is invoked.\n \n For information on how mouse wheel events are dispatched, see\n the class description for MouseWheelEvent.", "codes": ["public interface MouseWheelListener\nextends EventListener"], "fields": [], "methods": [{"method_name": "mouseWheelMoved", "method_sig": "void mouseWheelMoved (MouseWheelEvent e)", "description": "Invoked when the mouse wheel is rotated."}]}
