{"name": "Interface BlockingDeque<E>", "module": "java.base", "package": "java.util.concurrent", "text": "A Deque that additionally supports blocking operations that wait\n for the deque to become non-empty when retrieving an element, and wait for\n space to become available in the deque when storing an element.\n\n BlockingDeque methods come in four forms, with different ways\n of handling operations that cannot be satisfied immediately, but may be\n satisfied at some point in the future:\n one throws an exception, the second returns a special value (either\n null or false, depending on the operation), the third\n blocks the current thread indefinitely until the operation can succeed,\n and the fourth blocks for only a given maximum time limit before giving\n up.
