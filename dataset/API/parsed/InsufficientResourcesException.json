{"name": "Class InsufficientResourcesException", "module": "java.naming", "package": "javax.naming", "text": "This exception is thrown when resources are not available to complete\n the requested operation. This might due to a lack of resources on\n the server or on the client. There are no restrictions to resource types,\n as different services might make use of different resources. Such\n restrictions might be due to physical limits and/or administrative quotas.\n Examples of limited resources are internal buffers, memory, network bandwidth.\n\n InsufficientResourcesException is different from LimitExceededException in that\n the latter is due to user/system specified limits. See LimitExceededException\n for details.\n \n Synchronization and serialization issues that apply to NamingException\n apply directly here.", "codes": ["public class InsufficientResourcesException\nextends NamingException"], "fields": [], "methods": []}
