This class represents the definition of the week, for the\n purpose of providing TemporalField instances.\n \n WeekFields provides five fields,\n dayOfWeek(), weekOfMonth(), weekOfYear(),\n weekOfWeekBasedYear(), and weekBasedYear()\n that provide access to the values from any temporal object.\n \n The computations for day-of-week, week-of-month, and week-of-year are based\n on the  proleptic-year,\n month-of-year,\n day-of-month, and\n ISO day-of-week which are based on the\n epoch-day and the chronology.\n The values may not be aligned with the year-of-Era\n depending on the Chronology.\n A week is defined by:\n \nThe first day-of-week.\n For example, the ISO-8601 standard considers Monday to be the first day-of-week.\n The minimal number of days in the first week.\n For example, the ISO-8601 standard counts the first week as needing at least 4 days.\n \n Together these two values allow a year or month to be divided into weeks.\n\n Week of Month\n One field is used: week-of-month.\n The calculation ensures that weeks never overlap a month boundary.\n The month is divided into periods where each period starts on the defined first day-of-week.\n The earliest period is referred to as week 0 if it has less than the minimal number of days\n and week 1 if it has at least the minimal number of days.\n\n \nExamples of WeekFields\n\nDateDay-of-week\nFirst day: MondayMinimal days: 4First day: MondayMinimal days: 5\n\n\n2008-12-31Wednesday\nWeek 5 of December 2008Week 5 of December 2008\n2009-01-01Thursday\nWeek 1 of January 2009Week 0 of January 2009\n2009-01-04Sunday\nWeek 1 of January 2009Week 0 of January 2009\n2009-01-05Monday\nWeek 2 of January 2009Week 1 of January 2009\n\n\nWeek of Year\n One field is used: week-of-year.\n The calculation ensures that weeks never overlap a year boundary.\n The year is divided into periods where each period starts on the defined first day-of-week.\n The earliest period is referred to as week 0 if it has less than the minimal number of days\n and week 1 if it has at least the minimal number of days.\n\n Week Based Year\n Two fields are used for week-based-year, one for the\n week-of-week-based-year and one for\n week-based-year.  In a week-based-year, each week\n belongs to only a single year.  Week 1 of a year is the first week that\n starts on the first day-of-week and has at least the minimum number of days.\n The first and last weeks of a year may contain days from the\n previous calendar year or next calendar year respectively.\n\n \nExamples of WeekFields for week-based-year\n\nDateDay-of-week\nFirst day: MondayMinimal days: 4First day: MondayMinimal days: 5\n\n\n2008-12-31Wednesday\nWeek 1 of 2009Week 53 of 2008\n2009-01-01Thursday\nWeek 1 of 2009Week 53 of 2008\n2009-01-04Sunday\nWeek 1 of 2009Week 53 of 2008\n2009-01-05Monday\nWeek 2 of 2009Week 1 of 2009\n\n", "codes": ["public final class WeekFields\nextends Object\nimplements Serializable"], "fields": [{"field_name": "ISO", "field_sig": "public static final\u00a0WeekFields ISO", "description": "The ISO-8601 definition, where a week starts on Monday and the first week\n has a minimum of 4 days.\n \n The ISO-8601 standard defines a calendar system based on weeks.\n It uses the week-based-year and week-of-week-based-year concepts to split\n up the passage of days instead of the standard year/month/day.\n \n Note that the first week may start in the previous calendar year.\n Note also that the first few days of a calendar year may be in the\n week-based-year corresponding to the previous calendar year."}, {"field_name": "SUNDAY_START", "field_sig": "public static final\u00a0WeekFields SUNDAY_START", "description": "The common definition of a week that starts on Sunday and the first week\n has a minimum of 1 day.\n \n Defined as starting on Sunday and with a minimum of 1 day in the month.\n This week definition is in use in the US and other European countries."}, {"field_name": "WEEK_BASED_YEARS", "field_sig": "public static final\u00a0TemporalUnit WEEK_BASED_YEARS", "description": "The unit that represents week-based-years for the purpose of addition and subtraction.\n \n This allows a number of week-based-years to be added to, or subtracted from, a date.\n The unit is equal to either 52 or 53 weeks.\n The estimated duration of a week-based-year is the same as that of a standard ISO\n year at 365.2425 Days.\n \n The rules for addition add the number of week-based-years to the existing value\n for the week-based-year field retaining the week-of-week-based-year\n and day-of-week, unless the week number it too large for the target year.\n In that case, the week is set to the last week of the year\n with the same day-of-week.\n \n This unit is an immutable and thread-safe singleton."}], "methods": [{"method_name": "of", "method_sig": "public static WeekFields of (Locale locale)", "description": "Obtains an instance of WeekFields appropriate for a locale.\n \n This will look up appropriate values from the provider of localization data.\n If the locale contains \"fw\" (First day of week) and/or \"rg\"\n (Region Override) \n Unicode extensions, returned instance will reflect the values specified with\n those extensions.
