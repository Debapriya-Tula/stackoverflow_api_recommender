{"name": "Class CompoundName", "module": "java.naming", "package": "javax.naming", "text": "This class represents a compound name -- a name from\n a hierarchical name space.\n Each component in a compound name is an atomic name.\n \n The components of a compound name are numbered.  The indexes of a\n compound name with N components range from 0 up to, but not including, N.\n This range may be written as [0,N).\n The most significant component is at index 0.\n An empty compound name has no components.\n\n Compound Name Syntax\n The syntax of a compound name is specified using a set of properties:\n\njndi.syntax.direction\n  Direction for parsing (\"right_to_left\", \"left_to_right\", \"flat\").\n      If unspecified, defaults to \"flat\", which means the namespace is flat\n      with no hierarchical structure.\n\n  jndi.syntax.separator\n  Separator between atomic name components.\n      Required unless direction is \"flat\".\n\n  jndi.syntax.ignorecase\n  If present, \"true\" means ignore the case when comparing name\n      components. If its value is not \"true\", or if the property is not\n      present, case is considered when comparing name components.\n\n  jndi.syntax.escape\n  If present, specifies the escape string for overriding separator,\n      escapes and quotes.\n\n  jndi.syntax.beginquote\n  If present, specifies the string delimiting start of a quoted string.\n\n  jndi.syntax.endquote\n  String delimiting end of quoted string.\n      If present, specifies the string delimiting the end of a quoted string.\n      If not present, use syntax.beginquote as end quote.\n  jndi.syntax.beginquote2\n  Alternative set of begin/end quotes.\n\n  jndi.syntax.endquote2\n  Alternative set of begin/end quotes.\n\n  jndi.syntax.trimblanks\n  If present, \"true\" means trim any leading and trailing whitespaces\n      in a name component for comparison purposes. If its value is not\n      \"true\", or if the property is not present, blanks are significant.\n  jndi.syntax.separator.ava\n  If present, specifies the string that separates\n      attribute-value-assertions when specifying multiple attribute/value\n      pairs. (e.g. \",\"  in age=65,gender=male).\n  jndi.syntax.separator.typeval\n  If present, specifies the string that separates attribute\n              from value (e.g. \"=\" in \"age=65\")\n\n These properties are interpreted according to the following rules:\n\n\n In a string without quotes or escapes, any instance of the\n separator delimits two atomic names. Each atomic name is referred\n to as a component.\n\n A separator, quote or escape is escaped if preceded immediately\n (on the left) by the escape.\n\n If there are two sets of quotes, a specific begin-quote must be matched\n by its corresponding end-quote.\n\n A non-escaped begin-quote which precedes a component must be\n matched by a non-escaped end-quote at the end of the component.\n A component thus quoted is referred to as a\n quoted component. It is parsed by\n removing the being- and end- quotes, and by treating the intervening\n characters as ordinary characters unless one of the rules involving\n quoted components listed below applies.\n\n Quotes embedded in non-quoted components are treated as ordinary strings\n and need not be matched.\n\n A separator that is escaped or appears between non-escaped\n quotes is treated as an ordinary string and not a separator.\n\n An escape string within a quoted component acts as an escape only when\n followed by the corresponding end-quote string.\n This can be used to embed an escaped quote within a quoted component.\n\n An escaped escape string is not treated as an escape string.\n\n An escape string that does not precede a meta string (quotes or separator)\n and is not at the end of a component is treated as an ordinary string.\n\n A leading separator (the compound name string begins with\n a separator) denotes a leading empty atomic component (consisting\n of an empty string).\n A trailing separator (the compound name string ends with\n a separator) denotes a trailing empty atomic component.\n Adjacent separators denote an empty atomic component.\n\n\n The string form of the compound name follows the syntax described above.\n When the components of the compound name are turned into their\n string representation, the reserved syntax rules described above are\n applied (e.g. embedded separators are escaped or quoted)\n so that when the same string is parsed, it will yield the same components\n of the original compound name.\n\nMultithreaded Access\n A CompoundName instance is not synchronized against concurrent\n multithreaded access. Multiple threads trying to access and modify a\n CompoundName should lock the object.", "codes": ["public class CompoundName\nextends Object\nimplements Name"], "fields": [{"field_name": "mySyntax", "field_sig": "protected transient\u00a0Properties mySyntax", "description": "Syntax properties for this compound name.\n This field is initialized by the constructors and cannot be null.\n It should be treated as a read-only variable by subclasses.\n Any necessary changes to mySyntax should be made within constructors\n and not after the compound name has been instantiated."}], "methods": [{"method_name": "toString", "method_sig": "public String toString()", "description": "Generates the string representation of this compound name, using\n the syntax rules of the compound name.
