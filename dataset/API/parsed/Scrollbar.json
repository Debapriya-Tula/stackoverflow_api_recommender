{"name": "Class Scrollbar", "module": "java.desktop", "package": "java.awt", "text": "The Scrollbar class embodies a scroll bar, a\n familiar user-interface object. A scroll bar provides a\n convenient means for allowing a user to select from a\n range of values. The following three vertical\n scroll bars could be used as slider controls to pick\n the red, green, and blue components of a color:\n \n\n\n Each scroll bar in this example could be created with\n code similar to the following:\n\n \n redSlider=new Scrollbar(Scrollbar.VERTICAL, 0, 1, 0, 255);\n add(redSlider);\n \n\n Alternatively, a scroll bar can represent a range of values. For\n example, if a scroll bar is used for scrolling through text, the\n width of the \"bubble\" (also called the \"thumb\" or \"scroll box\")\n can be used to represent the amount of text that is visible.\n Here is an example of a scroll bar that represents a range:\n \n\n\n The value range represented by the bubble in this example\n is the visible amount. The horizontal scroll bar\n in this example could be created with code like the following:\n\n \n ranger = new Scrollbar(Scrollbar.HORIZONTAL, 0, 60, 0, 300);\n add(ranger);\n \n\n Note that the actual maximum value of the scroll bar is the\n maximum minus the visible amount.\n In the previous example, because the maximum is\n 300 and the visible amount is 60, the actual maximum\n value is 240.  The range of the scrollbar track is 0 - 300.\n The left side of the bubble indicates the value of the\n scroll bar.\n \n Normally, the user changes the value of the scroll bar by\n making a gesture with the mouse. For example, the user can\n drag the scroll bar's bubble up and down, or click in the\n scroll bar's unit increment or block increment areas. Keyboard\n gestures can also be mapped to the scroll bar. By convention,\n the Page\u00a0Up and Page\u00a0Down\n keys are equivalent to clicking in the scroll bar's block\n increment and block decrement areas.\n \n When the user changes the value of the scroll bar, the scroll bar\n receives an instance of AdjustmentEvent.\n The scroll bar processes this event, passing it along to\n any registered listeners.\n \n Any object that wishes to be notified of changes to the\n scroll bar's value should implement\n AdjustmentListener, an interface defined in\n the package java.awt.event.\n Listeners can be added and removed dynamically by calling\n the methods addAdjustmentListener and\n removeAdjustmentListener.\n \n The AdjustmentEvent class defines five types\n of adjustment event, listed here:\n\n \nAdjustmentEvent.TRACK is sent out when the\n user drags the scroll bar's bubble.\n AdjustmentEvent.UNIT_INCREMENT is sent out\n when the user clicks in the left arrow of a horizontal scroll\n bar, or the top arrow of a vertical scroll bar, or makes the\n equivalent gesture from the keyboard.\n AdjustmentEvent.UNIT_DECREMENT is sent out\n when the user clicks in the right arrow of a horizontal scroll\n bar, or the bottom arrow of a vertical scroll bar, or makes the\n equivalent gesture from the keyboard.\n AdjustmentEvent.BLOCK_INCREMENT is sent out\n when the user clicks in the track, to the left of the bubble\n on a horizontal scroll bar, or above the bubble on a vertical\n scroll bar. By convention, the Page\u00a0Up\n key is equivalent, if the user is using a keyboard that\n defines a Page\u00a0Up key.\n AdjustmentEvent.BLOCK_DECREMENT is sent out\n when the user clicks in the track, to the right of the bubble\n on a horizontal scroll bar, or below the bubble on a vertical\n scroll bar. By convention, the Page\u00a0Down\n key is equivalent, if the user is using a keyboard that\n defines a Page\u00a0Down key.\n \n\n The JDK\u00a01.0 event system is supported for backwards\n compatibility, but its use with newer versions of the platform is\n discouraged. The five types of adjustment events introduced\n with JDK\u00a01.1 correspond to the five event types\n that are associated with scroll bars in previous platform versions.\n The following list gives the adjustment event type,\n and the corresponding JDK\u00a01.0 event type it replaces.\n\n \nAdjustmentEvent.TRACK replaces\n Event.SCROLL_ABSOLUTE\nAdjustmentEvent.UNIT_INCREMENT replaces\n Event.SCROLL_LINE_UP\nAdjustmentEvent.UNIT_DECREMENT replaces\n Event.SCROLL_LINE_DOWN\nAdjustmentEvent.BLOCK_INCREMENT replaces\n Event.SCROLL_PAGE_UP\nAdjustmentEvent.BLOCK_DECREMENT replaces\n Event.SCROLL_PAGE_DOWN\n\n\nNote: We recommend using a Scrollbar\n for value selection only.  If you want to implement\n a scrollable component inside a container, we recommend you use\n a ScrollPane. If you use a\n Scrollbar for this purpose, you are likely to\n encounter issues with painting, key handling, sizing and\n positioning.", "codes": ["public class Scrollbar\nextends Component\nimplements Adjustable, Accessible"], "fields": [{"field_name": "HORIZONTAL", "field_sig": "public static final\u00a0int HORIZONTAL", "description": "A constant that indicates a horizontal scroll bar."}, {"field_name": "VERTICAL", "field_sig": "public static final\u00a0int VERTICAL", "description": "A constant that indicates a vertical scroll bar."}], "methods": [{"method_name": "addNotify", "method_sig": "public void addNotify()", "description": "Creates the Scrollbar's peer.
