The client asking for 10 answers and\n getting back 11 is a size limit exception.\n\n Examples of these limits include client and server configuration\n limits such as size, time, number of hops, etc.\n \n Synchronization and serialization issues that apply to NamingException\n apply directly here.", "codes": ["public class LimitExceededException\nextends NamingException"], "fields": [], "methods": []}
