The methods are not\n synchronized and should not be called from multiple threads without\n external synchronization. The build method returns a new\n HttpRequest each time it is invoked. Once built an \n HttpRequest is immutable, and can be sent multiple times.\n\n  Note, that not all request headers may be set by user code. Some are\n restricted for security reasons and others such as the headers relating\n to authentication, redirection and cookie management may be managed by\n specific APIs rather than through directly user set headers.", "codes": ["public static interface HttpRequest.Builder"], "fields": [], "methods": [{"method_name": "uri", "method_sig": "HttpRequest.Builder uri (URI uri)", "description": "Sets this HttpRequest's request URI."}, {"method_name": "expectContinue", "method_sig": "HttpRequest.Builder expectContinue (boolean enable)", "description": "Requests the server to acknowledge the request before sending the\n body.
