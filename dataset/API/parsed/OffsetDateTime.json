For example, the value\n \"2nd October 2007 at 13:45:30.123456789 +02:00\" can be stored in an OffsetDateTime.\n \nOffsetDateTime, ZonedDateTime and Instant all store an instant\n on the time-line to nanosecond precision.\n Instant is the simplest, simply representing the instant.\n OffsetDateTime adds to the instant the offset from UTC/Greenwich, which allows\n the local date-time to be obtained.\n ZonedDateTime adds full time-zone rules.\n \n It is intended that ZonedDateTime or Instant is used to model data\n in simpler applications. This class may be used when modeling date-time concepts in\n more detail, or when communicating to a database or in a network protocol.\n\n \n This is a value-based\n class; use of identity-sensitive
