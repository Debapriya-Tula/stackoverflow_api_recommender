Rather, a PrinterStateReasons\n attribute appears in the Print Service's attribute set.\n The PrinterStateReasons attribute contains zero,\n one, or more than one PrinterStateReason objects\n which pertain to the Print Service's status, and each\n PrinterStateReason object is associated with a\n Severity level of REPORT (least severe), WARNING, or\n ERROR (most severe). The printer adds a\n PrinterStateReason object to the Print Service's\n PrinterStateReasons attribute when the\n corresponding condition becomes true of the printer, and the printer removes\n the PrinterStateReason object again when the\n corresponding condition becomes false, regardless of whether the Print\n Service's overall PrinterState also changed.\n \nIPP Compatibility: Severity.toString() returns either \"error\",\n \"warning\", or \"report\". The string values returned by each individual\n PrinterStateReason and associated Severity object's\n toString() methods, concatenated together with a hyphen (\"-\")\n in between, gives the IPP keyword value for a PrinterStateReasons.\n The category name returned by getName() gives the IPP attribute name.", "codes": ["public final class Severity\nextends EnumSyntax\nimplements Attribute"], "fields": [{"field_name": "REPORT", "field_sig": "public static final\u00a0Severity REPORT", "description": "Indicates that the PrinterStateReason is a\n \"report\" (least severe).
