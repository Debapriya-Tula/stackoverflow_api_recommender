By contrast, the ChronoField class\n defines fields that only have meaning relative to the chronology.\n As such, ChronoField date fields are resolved here in the\n context of a specific chronology.\n \nChronoField instances are resolved by this method, which may\n be overridden in subclasses.\n \nEPOCH_DAY - If present, this is converted to a date and\n  all other date fields are then cross-checked against the date.\n PROLEPTIC_MONTH - If present, then it is split into the\n  YEAR and MONTH_OF_YEAR. If the mode is strict or smart\n  then the field is validated.\n YEAR_OF_ERA and ERA - If both are present, then they\n  are combined to form a YEAR. In lenient mode, the YEAR_OF_ERA\n  range is not validated, in smart and strict mode it is. The ERA is\n  validated for range in all three modes. If only the YEAR_OF_ERA is\n  present, and the mode is smart or lenient, then the last available era\n  is assumed. In strict mode, no era is assumed and the YEAR_OF_ERA is\n  left untouched.
