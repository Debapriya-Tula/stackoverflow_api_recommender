{"name": "Interface NClob", "module": "java.sql", "package": "java.sql", "text": "The mapping in the Java\u2122 programming language\n for the SQL NCLOB type.\n An SQL NCLOB is a built-in type\n that stores a Character Large Object using the National Character Set\n  as a column value in a row of  a database table.\n The NClob interface extends the Clob interface\n which provides methods for getting the\n length of an SQL NCLOB value,\n for materializing a NCLOB value on the client, and for\n searching for a substring or NCLOB object within a\n NCLOB value. A NClob object, just like a Clob object, is valid for the duration\n of the transaction in which it was created.\n Methods in the interfaces ResultSet,\n CallableStatement, and PreparedStatement, such as\n getNClob and setNClob allow a programmer to\n access an SQL NCLOB value.  In addition, this interface\n has methods for updating a NCLOB value.\n \n All methods on the NClob interface must be fully implemented if the\n JDBC driver supports the data type.", "codes": ["public interface NClob\nextends Clob"], "fields": [], "methods": []}
