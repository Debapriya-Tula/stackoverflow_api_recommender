{"name": "Class SynchronousQueue<E>", "module": "java.base", "package": "java.util.concurrent", "text": "A blocking queue in which each insert\n operation must wait for a corresponding remove operation by another\n thread, and vice versa.  A synchronous queue does not have any\n internal capacity, not even a capacity of one.  You cannot\n peek at a synchronous queue because an element is only\n present when you try to remove it; you cannot insert an element\n (using any method) unless another thread is trying to remove it;\n you cannot iterate as there is nothing to iterate.  The\n head of the queue is the element that the first queued\n inserting thread is trying to add to the queue; if there is no such\n queued thread then no element is available for removal and\n poll() will return null.  For purposes of other\n Collection methods (for example contains), a\n SynchronousQueue acts as an empty collection.  This queue\n does not permit null elements.\n\n Synchronous queues are similar to rendezvous channels used in\n CSP and Ada. They are well suited for handoff designs, in which an\n object running in one thread must sync up with an object running\n in another thread in order to hand it some information, event, or\n task.\n\n This class supports an optional fairness policy for ordering\n waiting producer and consumer threads.  By default, this ordering\n is not guaranteed. However, a queue constructed with fairness set\n to true grants threads access in FIFO order.\n\n This class and its iterator implement all of the optional\n methods of the Collection and Iterator interfaces.\n\n This class is a member of the\n \n Java Collections Framework.", "codes": ["public class SynchronousQueue<E>\nextends AbstractQueue<E>\nimplements BlockingQueue<E>, Serializable"], "fields": [], "methods": [{"method_name": "put", "method_sig": "public void put (E e)\n         throws InterruptedException", "description": "Adds the specified element to this queue, waiting if necessary for\n another thread to receive it."}, {"method_name": "offer", "method_sig": "public boolean offer (E e,\n                     long timeout,\n                     TimeUnit unit)\n              throws InterruptedException", "description": "Inserts the specified element into this queue, waiting if necessary\n up to the specified wait time for another thread to receive it."}, {"method_name": "offer", "method_sig": "public boolean offer (E e)", "description": "Inserts the specified element into this queue, if another thread is\n waiting to receive it."}, {"method_name": "take", "method_sig": "public E take()\n       throws InterruptedException", "description": "Retrieves and removes the head of this queue, waiting if necessary\n for another thread to insert it."}, {"method_name": "poll", "method_sig": "public E poll (long timeout,\n              TimeUnit unit)\n       throws InterruptedException", "description": "Retrieves and removes the head of this queue, waiting\n if necessary up to the specified wait time, for another thread\n to insert it."}, {"method_name": "poll", "method_sig": "public E poll()", "description": "Retrieves and removes the head of this queue, if another thread\n is currently making an element available."}, {"method_name": "isEmpty", "method_sig": "public boolean isEmpty()", "description": "Always returns true.\n A SynchronousQueue has no internal capacity."}, {"method_name": "size", "method_sig": "public int size()", "description": "Always returns zero.\n A SynchronousQueue has no internal capacity."}, {"method_name": "remainingCapacity", "method_sig": "public int remainingCapacity()", "description": "Always returns zero.\n A SynchronousQueue has no internal capacity."}, {"method_name": "clear", "method_sig": "public void clear()", "description": "Does nothing.\n A SynchronousQueue has no internal capacity."}, {"method_name": "contains", "method_sig": "public boolean contains (Object o)", "description": "Always returns false.\n A SynchronousQueue has no internal capacity."}, {"method_name": "remove", "method_sig": "public boolean remove (Object o)", "description": "Always returns false.\n A SynchronousQueue has no internal capacity."}, {"method_name": "containsAll", "method_sig": "public boolean containsAll (Collection<?> c)", "description": "Returns false unless the given collection is empty.\n A SynchronousQueue has no internal capacity."}, {"method_name": "removeAll", "method_sig": "public boolean removeAll (Collection<?> c)", "description": "Always returns false.\n A SynchronousQueue has no internal capacity."}, {"method_name": "retainAll", "method_sig": "public boolean retainAll (Collection<?> c)", "description": "Always returns false.\n A SynchronousQueue has no internal capacity."}, {"method_name": "peek", "method_sig": "public E peek()", "description": "Always returns null.\n A SynchronousQueue does not return elements\n unless actively waited on."}, {"method_name": "iterator", "method_sig": "public Iterator<E> iterator()", "description": "Returns an empty iterator in which hasNext always returns\n false."}, {"method_name": "spliterator", "method_sig": "public Spliterator<E> spliterator()", "description": "Returns an empty spliterator in which calls to\n trySplit always return null."}, {"method_name": "toArray", "method_sig": "public Object[] toArray()", "description": "Returns a zero-length array."}, {"method_name": "toArray", "method_sig": "public <T> T[] toArray (T[] a)", "description": "Sets the zeroth element of the specified array to null\n (if the array has non-zero length) and returns it."}, {"method_name": "toString", "method_sig": "public String toString()", "description": "Always returns \"[]\"."}, {"method_name": "drainTo", "method_sig": "public int drainTo (Collection<? super E> c)", "description": "Description copied from interface:\u00a0BlockingQueue"}, {"method_name": "drainTo", "method_sig": "public int drainTo (Collection<? super E> c,\n                   int maxElements)", "description": "Description copied from interface:\u00a0BlockingQueue"}]}
