{"name": "Class Vector<E>", "module": "java.base", "package": "java.util", "text": "The Vector class implements a growable array of\n objects. Like an array, it contains components that can be\n accessed using an integer index. However, the size of a\n Vector can grow or shrink as needed to accommodate\n adding and removing items after the Vector has been created.\n\n Each vector tries to optimize storage management by maintaining a\n capacity and a capacityIncrement. The\n capacity is always at least as large as the vector\n size; it is usually larger because as components are added to the\n vector, the vector's storage increases in chunks the size of\n capacityIncrement. An application can increase the\n capacity of a vector before inserting a large number of\n components; this reduces the amount of incremental reallocation.\n\n \n The iterators returned by this class's iterator and\n listIterator methods are fail-fast:\n if the vector is structurally modified at any time after the iterator is\n created, in any way except through the iterator's own\n remove or\n add methods, the iterator will throw a\n ConcurrentModificationException.  Thus, in the face of\n concurrent modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather\n than risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined\n time in the future.  The Enumerations returned by\n the elements method are not fail-fast; if the\n Vector is structurally modified at any time after the enumeration is\n created then the results of enumerating are undefined.\n\n Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed\n as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the\n presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification.  Fail-fast iterators\n throw ConcurrentModificationException on a best-effort basis.\n Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this\n exception for its correctness:  the fail-fast behavior of iterators\n should be used only to detect bugs.\nAs of the Java 2 platform v1.2, this class was retrofitted to\n implement the List interface, making it a member of the\n \n Java Collections Framework.  Unlike the new collection\n implementations, Vector is synchronized.
