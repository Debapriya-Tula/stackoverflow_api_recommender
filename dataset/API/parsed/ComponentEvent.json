The event is passed to every ComponentListener\n or ComponentAdapter object which registered to receive such\n events using the component's addComponentListener method.\n (ComponentAdapter objects implement the\n ComponentListener interface.) Each such listener object\n gets this ComponentEvent when the event occurs.\n \n An unspecified behavior will be caused if the id parameter\n of any particular ComponentEvent instance is not\n in the range from COMPONENT_FIRST to COMPONENT_LAST.", "codes": ["public class ComponentEvent\nextends AWTEvent"], "fields": [{"field_name": "COMPONENT_FIRST", "field_sig": "public static final\u00a0int COMPONENT_FIRST", "description": "The first number in the range of ids used for component events."}, {"field_name": "COMPONENT_LAST", "field_sig": "public static final\u00a0int COMPONENT_LAST", "description": "The last number in the range of ids used for component events."}, {"field_name": "COMPONENT_MOVED", "field_sig": "@Native\npublic static final\u00a0int COMPONENT_MOVED", "description": "This event indicates that the component's position changed."}, {"field_name": "COMPONENT_RESIZED", "field_sig": "@Native\npublic static final\u00a0int COMPONENT_RESIZED", "description": "This event indicates that the component's size changed."}, {"field_name": "COMPONENT_SHOWN", "field_sig": "@Native\npublic static final\u00a0int COMPONENT_SHOWN", "description": "This event indicates that the component was made visible."}, {"field_name": "COMPONENT_HIDDEN", "field_sig": "@Native\npublic static final\u00a0int COMPONENT_HIDDEN", "description": "This event indicates that the component was rendered invisible."}], "methods": [{"method_name": "getComponent", "method_sig": "public Component getComponent()", "description": "Returns the originator of the event."}, {"method_name": "paramString", "method_sig": "public String paramString()", "description": "Returns a parameter string identifying this event.\n This method is useful for event-logging and for debugging."}]}
