Normally,\n all the attributes are examined and used to select and\n configure a Font instance.  If a FONT\n attribute is present, though, its associated Font\n will be used.  This provides a way for users to override the\n resolution of font attributes into a Font, or\n force use of a particular Font instance.  This\n also allows users to specify subclasses of Font in\n cases where a Font can be subclassed.\n\n FONT is used for special situations where\n clients already have a Font instance but still\n need to use Map-based APIs.  Typically, there will\n be no other attributes in the Map except the\n FONT attribute.  With Map-based APIs\n the common case is to specify all attributes individually, so\n FONT is not needed or desirable.\n\n However, if both FONT and other attributes are\n present in the Map, the rendering system will\n merge the attributes defined in the Font with the\n additional attributes.

Then only the secondary\n attributes from the original Map are added to\n those in the new Map.  Thus the values of primary\n attributes come solely from the Font, and the\n values of secondary attributes originate with the\n Font but can be overridden by other values in the\n Map.\n\n Note:Font's Map-based\n constructor and deriveFont methods do not process\n the FONT attribute, as these are used to create\n new Font objects.
