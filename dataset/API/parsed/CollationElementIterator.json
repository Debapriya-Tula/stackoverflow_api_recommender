{"name": "Class CollationElementIterator", "module": "java.base", "package": "java.text", "text": "The CollationElementIterator class is used as an iterator\n to walk through each character of an international string. Use the iterator\n to return the ordering priority of the positioned character. The ordering\n priority of a character, which we refer to as a key, defines how a character\n is collated in the given collation object.\n\n \n For example, consider the following in Spanish:\n \n\n \"ca\" \u2192 the first key is key('c') and second key is key('a').\n \"cha\" \u2192 the first key is key('ch') and second key is key('a').\n \n\n And in German,\n \n\n \"\u00e4b\" \u2192 the first key is key('a'), the second key is key('e'), and\n the third key is key('b').\n \n\n The key of a character is an integer composed of primary order(short),\n secondary order(byte), and tertiary order(byte). Java strictly defines\n the size and signedness of its primitive data types. Therefore, the static\n functions primaryOrder, secondaryOrder, and\n tertiaryOrder return int, short,\n and short respectively to ensure the correctness of the key\n value.\n\n \n Example of the iterator usage,\n \n\n\n  String testString = \"This is a test\";\n  Collator col = Collator.getInstance();\n  if (col instanceof RuleBasedCollator) {\n      RuleBasedCollator ruleBasedCollator = (RuleBasedCollator)col;\n      CollationElementIterator collationElementIterator = ruleBasedCollator.getCollationElementIterator(testString);\n      int primaryOrder = CollationElementIterator.primaryOrder(collationElementIterator.next());\n          :\n  }\n \n\n\nCollationElementIterator.next returns the collation order\n of the next character. A collation order consists of primary order,\n secondary order and tertiary order. The data type of the collation\n order is int. The first 16 bits of a collation order\n is its primary order; the next 8 bits is the secondary order and the\n last 8 bits is the tertiary order.\n\n Note: CollationElementIterator is a part of\n RuleBasedCollator implementation. It is only usable\n with RuleBasedCollator instances.", "codes": ["public final class CollationElementIterator\nextends Object"], "fields": [{"field_name": "NULLORDER", "field_sig": "public static final\u00a0int NULLORDER", "description": "Null order which indicates the end of string is reached by the\n cursor."}], "methods": [{"method_name": "reset", "method_sig": "public void reset()", "description": "Resets the cursor to the beginning of the string.
