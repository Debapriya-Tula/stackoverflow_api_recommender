{"name": "Interface Name", "module": "java.naming", "package": "javax.naming", "text": "The Name interface represents a generic name -- an ordered\n sequence of components.

The indexes of a name\n with N components range from 0 up to, but not including, N.  This\n range may be written as [0,N).\n The most significant component is at index 0.\n An empty name has no components.\n\n  None of the methods in this interface accept null as a valid\n value for a parameter that is a name or a name component.\n Likewise, methods that return a name or name component never return null.\n\n  An instance of a Name may not be synchronized against\n concurrent multithreaded access if that access is not read-only.", "codes": ["public interface Name\nextends Cloneable, Serializable, Comparable<Object>"], "fields": [{"field_name": "serialVersionUID", "field_sig": "static final\u00a0long serialVersionUID", "description": "The class fingerprint that is set to indicate\n serialization compatibility with a previous\n version of the class."}], "methods": [{"method_name": "clone", "method_sig": "Object clone()", "description": "Generates a new copy of this name.\n Subsequent changes to the components of this name will not\n affect the new copy, and vice versa."}, {"method_name": "compareTo", "method_sig": "int compareTo (Object obj)", "description": "Compares this name with another name for order.\n Returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as this\n name is less than, equal to, or greater than the given name.\n\n  As with Object.equals(), the notion of ordering for names\n depends on the class that implements this interface.\n For example, the ordering may be\n based on lexicographical ordering of the name components.\n Specific attributes of the name, such as how it treats case,\n may affect the ordering.
