{"name": "Interface Position", "module": "java.desktop", "package": "javax.swing.text", "text": "Represents a location within a document.  It is intended to abstract away\n implementation details of the document and enable specification of\n positions within the document that are capable of tracking of change as\n the document is edited.\n \n A Position object points at a location between two characters.\n As the surrounding content is altered, the Position object\n adjusts its offset automatically to reflect the changes. If content is\n inserted or removed before the Position object's location, then the\n Position increments or decrements its offset, respectively,\n so as to point to the same location. If a portion of the document is removed\n that contains a Position's offset, then the Position's\n offset becomes that of the beginning of the removed region. For example, if\n a Position has an offset of 5 and the region 2-10 is removed, then\n the Position's offset becomes 2.\n \nPosition with an offset of 0 is a special case. It never changes its\n offset while document content is altered.", "codes": ["public interface Position"], "fields": [], "methods": [{"method_name": "getOffset", "method_sig": "int getOffset()", "description": "Fetches the current offset within the document."}]}
