{"name": "Class InetAddress", "module": "java.base", "package": "java.net", "text": "This class represents an Internet Protocol (IP) address.\n\n  An IP address is either a 32-bit or 128-bit unsigned number\n used by IP, a lower-level protocol on which protocols like UDP and\n TCP are built. The IP address architecture is defined by RFC\u00a0790:\n Assigned Numbers,  RFC\u00a01918:\n Address Allocation for Private Internets, RFC\u00a02365:\n Administratively Scoped IP Multicast, and RFC\u00a02373: IP\n Version 6 Addressing Architecture. An instance of an\n InetAddress consists of an IP address and possibly its\n corresponding host name (depending on whether it is constructed\n with a host name or whether it has already done reverse host name\n resolution).\n\n  Address types \n\nDescription of unicast and multicast address types\n\nAddress TypeDescription\n\n\nunicast\nAn identifier for a single interface. A packet sent to\n         a unicast address is delivered to the interface identified by\n         that address.\n\n          The Unspecified Address -- Also called anylocal or wildcard\n         address. It must never be assigned to any node. It indicates the\n         absence of an address. One example of its use is as the target of\n         bind, which allows a server to accept a client connection on any\n         interface, in case the server host has multiple interfaces.\n\n          The unspecified address must not be used as\n         the destination address of an IP packet.\n\n          The Loopback Addresses -- This is the address\n         assigned to the loopback interface. Anything sent to this\n         IP address loops around and becomes IP input on the local\n         host. This address is often used when testing a\n         client.\nmulticast\nAn identifier for a set of interfaces (typically belonging\n         to different nodes). A packet sent to a multicast address is\n         delivered to all interfaces identified by that address.\n\n\n IP address scope \n Link-local addresses are designed to be used for addressing\n on a single link for purposes such as auto-address configuration,\n neighbor discovery, or when no routers are present.\n\n  Site-local addresses are designed to be used for addressing\n inside of a site without the need for a global prefix.\n\n  Global addresses are unique across the internet.\n\n  Textual representation of IP addresses \n\n The textual representation of an IP address is address family specific.\n\n \n\n For IPv4 address format, please refer to Inet4Address#format; For IPv6\n address format, please refer to Inet6Address#format.\n\n There is a couple of\n System Properties affecting how IPv4 and IPv6 addresses are used.\n Host Name Resolution \n\n Host name-to-IP address resolution is accomplished through\n the use of a combination of local machine configuration information\n and network naming services such as the Domain Name System (DNS)\n and Network Information Service(NIS). The particular naming\n services(s) being used is by default the local machine configured\n one. For any host name, its corresponding IP address is returned.\n\n  Reverse name resolution means that for any IP address,\n the host associated with the IP address is returned.\n\n  The InetAddress class provides methods to resolve host names to\n their IP addresses and vice versa.\n\n  InetAddress Caching \n\n The InetAddress class has a cache to store successful as well as\n unsuccessful host name resolutions.\n\n  By default, when a security manager is installed, in order to\n protect against DNS spoofing attacks,\n the result of positive host name resolutions are\n cached forever. When a security manager is not installed, the default\n behavior is to cache entries for a finite (implementation dependent)\n period of time. The result of unsuccessful host\n name resolution is cached for a very short period of time (10\n seconds) to improve performance.\n\n  If the default behavior is not desired, then a Java security property\n can be set to a different Time-to-live (TTL) value for positive\n caching. Likewise, a system admin can configure a different\n negative caching TTL value when needed.\n\n  Two Java security properties control the TTL values used for\n  positive and negative host name resolution caching:\n\n \nnetworkaddress.cache.ttl\nIndicates the caching policy for successful name lookups from\n the name service. The value is specified as an integer to indicate\n the number of seconds to cache the successful lookup. The default\n setting is to cache for an implementation specific period of time.\n \n A value of -1 indicates \"cache forever\".\n \nnetworkaddress.cache.negative.ttl (default: 10)\nIndicates the caching policy for un-successful name lookups\n from the name service. The value is specified as an integer to\n indicate the number of seconds to cache the failure for\n un-successful lookups.\n \n A value of 0 indicates \"never cache\".\n A value of -1 indicates \"cache forever\".\n \n", "codes": ["public class InetAddress\nextends Object\nimplements Serializable"], "fields": [], "methods": [{"method_name": "isMulticastAddress", "method_sig": "public boolean isMulticastAddress()", "description": "Utility routine to check if the InetAddress is an\n IP multicast address."}, {"method_name": "isAnyLocalAddress", "method_sig": "public boolean isAnyLocalAddress()", "description": "Utility routine to check if the InetAddress is a wildcard address."}, {"method_name": "isLoopbackAddress", "method_sig": "public boolean isLoopbackAddress()", "description": "Utility routine to check if the InetAddress is a loopback address."}, {"method_name": "isLinkLocalAddress", "method_sig": "public boolean isLinkLocalAddress()", "description": "Utility routine to check if the InetAddress is an link local address."}, {"method_name": "isSiteLocalAddress", "method_sig": "public boolean isSiteLocalAddress()", "description": "Utility routine to check if the InetAddress is a site local address."}, {"method_name": "isMCGlobal", "method_sig": "public boolean isMCGlobal()", "description": "Utility routine to check if the multicast address has global scope."}, {"method_name": "isMCNodeLocal", "method_sig": "public boolean isMCNodeLocal()", "description": "Utility routine to check if the multicast address has node scope."}, {"method_name": "isMCLinkLocal", "method_sig": "public boolean isMCLinkLocal()", "description": "Utility routine to check if the multicast address has link scope."}, {"method_name": "isMCSiteLocal", "method_sig": "public boolean isMCSiteLocal()", "description": "Utility routine to check if the multicast address has site scope."}, {"method_name": "isMCOrgLocal", "method_sig": "public boolean isMCOrgLocal()", "description": "Utility routine to check if the multicast address has organization scope."}, {"method_name": "isReachable", "method_sig": "public boolean isReachable (int timeout)\n                    throws IOException", "description": "Test whether that address is reachable.
