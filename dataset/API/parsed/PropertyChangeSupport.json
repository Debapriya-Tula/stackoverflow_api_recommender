{"name": "Class PropertyChangeSupport", "module": "java.desktop", "package": "java.beans", "text": "This is a utility class that can be used by beans that support bound\n properties.  It manages a list of listeners and dispatches\n PropertyChangeEvents to them.  You can use an instance of this class\n as a member field of your bean and delegate these types of work to it.\n The PropertyChangeListener can be registered for all properties\n or for a property specified by name.\n \n Here is an example of PropertyChangeSupport usage that follows\n the rules and recommendations laid out in the JavaBeans\u2122 specification:\n \n public class MyBean {\n     private final PropertyChangeSupport pcs = new PropertyChangeSupport(this);\n\n     public void addPropertyChangeListener(PropertyChangeListener listener) {\n         this.pcs.addPropertyChangeListener(listener);\n     }\n\n     public void removePropertyChangeListener(PropertyChangeListener listener) {\n         this.pcs.removePropertyChangeListener(listener);\n     }\n\n     private String value;\n\n     public String getValue() {\n         return this.value;\n     }\n\n     public void setValue(String newValue) {\n         String oldValue = this.value;\n         this.value = newValue;\n         this.pcs.firePropertyChange(\"value\", oldValue, newValue);\n     }\n\n     [...]\n }\n \n\n A PropertyChangeSupport instance is thread-safe.\n \n This class is serializable.  When it is serialized it will save\n (and restore) any listeners that are themselves serializable.  Any\n non-serializable listeners will be skipped during serialization.", "codes": ["public class PropertyChangeSupport\nextends Object\nimplements Serializable"], "fields": [], "methods": [{"method_name": "addPropertyChangeListener", "method_sig": "public void addPropertyChangeListener (PropertyChangeListener listener)", "description": "Add a PropertyChangeListener to the listener list.\n The listener is registered for all properties.\n The same listener object may be added more than once, and will be called\n as many times as it is added.\n If listener is null, no exception is thrown and no action\n is taken."}, {"method_name": "removePropertyChangeListener", "method_sig": "public void removePropertyChangeListener (PropertyChangeListener listener)", "description": "Remove a PropertyChangeListener from the listener list.\n This removes a PropertyChangeListener that was registered\n for all properties.\n If listener was added more than once to the same event\n source, it will be notified one less time after being removed.\n If listener is null, or was never added, no exception is\n thrown and no action is taken."}, {"method_name": "getPropertyChangeListeners", "method_sig": "public PropertyChangeListener[] getPropertyChangeListeners()", "description": "Returns an array of all the listeners that were added to the\n PropertyChangeSupport object with addPropertyChangeListener().\n \n If some listeners have been added with a named property, then\n the returned array will be a mixture of PropertyChangeListeners\n and PropertyChangeListenerProxys.
