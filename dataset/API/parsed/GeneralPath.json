It can contain multiple subpaths.\n \nGeneralPath is a legacy final class which exactly\n implements the behavior of its superclass Path2D.Float.\n Together with Path2D.Double, the Path2D classes\n provide full implementations of a general geometric path that\n support all of the functionality of the Shape and\n PathIterator interfaces with the ability to explicitly\n select different levels of internal coordinate precision.\n \n Use Path2D.Float (or this legacy GeneralPath\n subclass) when dealing with data that can be represented\n and used with floating point precision.  Use Path2D.Double\n for data that requires the accuracy or range of double precision.", "codes": ["public final class GeneralPath\nextends Path2D.Float"], "fields": [], "methods": []}
