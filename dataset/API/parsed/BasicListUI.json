Where\n     visibleRowCount is used to determine the number of columns.\n     Because this lays out horizontally the number of rows is\n     then determined from the column count. For example, lets say\n     you have a model with 10 items and the visible row count is 8.\n     The number of columns needed to display this is 2, but you no\n     longer need 8 rows to display this, you only need 5, thus\n     the adjustedRowCount is 5.\n     \n     If the visible row count is <= 0, the preferred height is dictated\n     by the number of columns, which will be as many as can fit in the\n     width of the JList (width / max cell width), with at least\n     one column. The preferred height then becomes the model size / number\n     of columns * maximum cell height.
