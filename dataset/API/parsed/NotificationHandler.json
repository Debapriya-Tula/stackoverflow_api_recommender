When a\n notification is received the handleNotification method of the handler is invoked to handle that\n notification.\n\n  Additionally, an attachment object can be attached to the receive\n operation to provide context when consuming the notification. The\n attachment is important for cases where a state-less \n NotificationHandler is used to consume the result of many receive\n operations.\n\n  Handler implementations are encouraged to extend the AbstractNotificationHandler class which implements this interface and\n provide notification specific methods. However, an API should generally use\n this handler interface as the type for parameters, return type, etc. rather\n than the abstract class.", "codes": ["public interface NotificationHandler<T>"], "fields": [], "methods": [{"method_name": "handleNotification", "method_sig": "HandlerResult handleNotification (Notification notification,\n                                 T attachment)", "description": "Invoked when a notification is received from the SCTP stack."}]}
