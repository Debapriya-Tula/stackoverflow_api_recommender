A Duration will add an exact\n number of seconds, thus a duration of one day is always exactly 24 hours.\n By contrast, a Period will add a conceptual day, trying to maintain\n the local time.\n \n For example, consider adding a period of one day and a duration of one day to\n 18:00 on the evening before a daylight savings gap. The Period will add\n the conceptual day and result in a ZonedDateTime at 18:00 the following day.\n By contrast, the Duration will add exactly 24 hours, resulting in a\n ZonedDateTime at 19:00 the following day (assuming a one hour DST gap).\n \n The supported units of a period are YEARS,\n MONTHS and DAYS.\n All three fields are always present, but may be set to zero.\n \n The ISO-8601 calendar system is the modern civil calendar system used today\n in most of the world. It is equivalent to the proleptic Gregorian calendar\n system, in which today's rules for leap years are applied for all time.\n \n The period is modeled as a directed amount of time, meaning that individual parts of the\n period may be negative.\n\n \n This is a value-based\n class; use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality\n (==), identity hash code, or synchronization) on instances of\n Period may have unpredictable results and should be avoided.\n The equals method should be used for comparisons.", "codes": ["public final class Period\nextends Object\nimplements ChronoPeriod, Serializable"], "fields": [{"field_name": "ZERO", "field_sig": "public static final\u00a0Period ZERO", "description": "A constant for a period of zero."}], "methods": [{"method_name": "ofYears", "method_sig": "public static Period ofYears (int years)", "description": "Obtains a Period representing a number of years.\n \n The resulting period will have the specified years.\n The months and days units will be zero."}, {"method_name": "ofMonths", "method_sig": "public static Period ofMonths (int months)", "description": "Obtains a Period representing a number of months.\n \n The resulting period will have the specified months.\n The years and days units will be zero."}, {"method_name": "ofWeeks", "method_sig": "public static Period ofWeeks (int weeks)", "description": "Obtains a Period representing a number of weeks.\n \n The resulting period will be day-based, with the amount of days\n equal to the number of weeks multiplied by 7.\n The years and months units will be zero."}, {"method_name": "ofDays", "method_sig": "public static Period ofDays (int days)", "description": "Obtains a Period representing a number of days.\n \n The resulting period will have the specified days.\n The years and months units will be zero."}, {"method_name": "of", "method_sig": "public static Period of (int years,\n                        int months,\n                        int days)", "description": "Obtains a Period representing a number of years, months and days.\n \n This creates an instance based on years, months and days."}, {"method_name": "from", "method_sig": "public static Period from (TemporalAmount amount)", "description": "Obtains an instance of Period from a temporal amount.\n \n This obtains a period based on the specified amount.\n A TemporalAmount represents an  amount of time, which may be\n date-based or time-based, which this factory extracts to a Period.\n \n The conversion loops around the set of units from the amount and uses\n the YEARS, MONTHS\n and DAYS units to create a period.\n If any other units are found then an exception is thrown.\n \n If the amount is a ChronoPeriod then it must use the ISO chronology."}, {"method_name": "parse", "method_sig": "public static Period parse (CharSequence text)", "description": "Obtains a Period from a text string such as PnYnMnD.\n \n This will parse the string produced by toString() which is\n based on the ISO-8601 period formats PnYnMnD and PnW.\n \n The string starts with an optional sign, denoted by the ASCII negative\n or positive symbol.
