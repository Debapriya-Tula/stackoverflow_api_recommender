Typically, message\n authentication codes are used between two parties that share a secret\n key in order to validate information transmitted between these\n parties.\n\n  A MAC mechanism that is based on cryptographic hash functions is\n referred to as HMAC. HMAC can be used with any cryptographic hash function,\n e.g., SHA256 or SHA384, in combination with a secret shared key. HMAC is\n specified in RFC 2104.\n\n  Every implementation of the Java platform is required to support\n the following standard Mac algorithms:\n \nHmacMD5\nHmacSHA1\nHmacSHA256\n\n These algorithms are described in the\n \n Mac section of the\n Java Security Standard Algorithm Names Specification.\n Consult the release documentation for your implementation to see if any\n other algorithms are supported.", "codes": ["public class Mac\nextends Object\nimplements Cloneable"], "fields": [], "methods": [{"method_name": "getAlgorithm", "method_sig": "public final String getAlgorithm()", "description": "Returns the algorithm name of this Mac object.\n\n This is the same name that was specified in one of the\n getInstance calls that created this\n Mac object."}, {"method_name": "getInstance", "method_sig": "public static final Mac getInstance (String algorithm)\n                             throws NoSuchAlgorithmException", "description": "Returns a Mac object that implements the\n specified MAC algorithm.\n\n  This method traverses the list of registered security Providers,\n starting with the most preferred Provider.\n A new Mac object encapsulating the\n MacSpi implementation from the first\n Provider that supports the specified algorithm is returned.\n\n  Note that the list of registered providers may be retrieved via\n the Security.getProviders() method."}, {"method_name": "getInstance", "method_sig": "public static final Mac getInstance (String algorithm,\n                                    String provider)\n                             throws NoSuchAlgorithmException,\n                                    NoSuchProviderException", "description": "Returns a Mac object that implements the\n specified MAC algorithm.\n\n  A new Mac object encapsulating the\n MacSpi implementation from the specified provider\n is returned.
