{"name": "Interface Temporal", "module": "java.base", "package": "java.time.temporal", "text": "Framework-level interface defining read-write access to a temporal object,\n such as a date, time, offset or some combination of these.\n \n This is the base interface type for date, time and offset objects that\n are complete enough to be manipulated using plus and minus.\n It is implemented by those classes that can provide and manipulate information\n as fields or queries.\n See TemporalAccessor for the read-only version of this interface.\n \n Most date and time information can be represented as a number.\n These are modeled using TemporalField with the number held using\n a long to handle large values. Year, month and day-of-month are\n simple examples of fields, but they also include instant and offsets.\n See ChronoField for the standard set of fields.\n \n Two pieces of date/time information cannot be represented by numbers,\n the chronology and the\n time-zone.\n These can be accessed via queries using\n the static methods defined on TemporalQuery.\n \n This interface is a framework-level interface that should not be widely\n used in application code. Instead, applications should create and pass\n around instances of concrete types, such as LocalDate.\n There are many reasons for this, part of which is that implementations\n of this interface may be in calendar systems other than ISO.\n See ChronoLocalDate for a fuller discussion of the issues.\n\n When to implement\n\n A class should implement this interface if it meets three criteria:\n \nit provides access to date/time/offset information, as per TemporalAccessor\nthe set of fields are contiguous from the largest to the smallest\n the set of fields are complete, such that no other field is needed to define the\n  valid range of values for the fields that are represented\n \n\n Four examples make this clear:\n \nLocalDate implements this interface as it represents a set of fields\n  that are contiguous from days to forever and require no external information to determine\n  the validity of each date. It is therefore able to implement plus/minus correctly.\n LocalTime implements this interface as it represents a set of fields\n  that are contiguous from nanos to within days and require no external information to determine\n  validity. It is able to implement plus/minus correctly, by wrapping around the day.\n MonthDay, the combination of month-of-year and day-of-month, does not implement\n  this interface.  While the combination is contiguous, from days to months within years,\n  the combination does not have sufficient information to define the valid range of values\n  for day-of-month.  As such, it is unable to implement plus/minus correctly.\n The combination day-of-week and day-of-month (\"Friday the 13th\") should not implement\n  this interface. It does not represent a contiguous set of fields, as days to weeks overlaps\n  days to months.\n ", "codes": ["public interface Temporal\nextends TemporalAccessor"], "fields": [], "methods": [{"method_name": "isSupported", "method_sig": "boolean isSupported (TemporalUnit unit)", "description": "Checks if the specified unit is supported.\n \n This checks if the specified unit can be added to, or subtracted from, this date-time.\n If false, then calling the plus(long, TemporalUnit) and\n minus methods will throw an exception."}, {"method_name": "with", "method_sig": "default Temporal with (TemporalAdjuster adjuster)", "description": "Returns an adjusted object of the same type as this object with the adjustment made.\n \n This adjusts this date-time according to the rules of the specified adjuster.\n A simple adjuster might simply set the one of the fields, such as the year field.\n A more complex adjuster might set the date to the last day of the month.\n A selection of common adjustments is provided in\n TemporalAdjusters.\n These include finding the \"last day of the month\" and \"next Wednesday\".\n The adjuster is responsible for handling special cases, such as the varying\n lengths of month and leap years.\n \n Some example code indicating how and why this method is used:\n \n  date = date.with(Month.JULY);        // most key classes implement TemporalAdjuster\n  date = date.with(lastDayOfMonth());  // static import from Adjusters\n  date = date.with(next(WEDNESDAY));   // static import from Adjusters and DayOfWeek\n "}, {"method_name": "with", "method_sig": "Temporal with (TemporalField field,\n              long newValue)", "description": "Returns an object of the same type as this object with the specified field altered.\n \n This returns a new object based on this one with the value for the specified field changed.\n For example, on a LocalDate, this could be used to set the year, month or day-of-month.\n The returned object will have the same observable type as this object.\n \n In some cases, changing a field is not fully defined.
