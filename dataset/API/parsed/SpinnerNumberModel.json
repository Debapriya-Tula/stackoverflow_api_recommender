{"name": "Class SpinnerNumberModel", "module": "java.desktop", "package": "javax.swing", "text": "A SpinnerModel for sequences of numbers.\n The upper and lower bounds of the sequence are defined\n by properties called minimum and\n maximum. The size of the increase or decrease\n computed by the nextValue and\n previousValue methods is defined by a property called\n stepSize.  The minimum and\n maximum properties can be null\n to indicate that the sequence has no lower or upper limit.\n All of the properties in this class are defined in terms of two\n generic types: Number and\n Comparable, so that all Java numeric types\n may be accommodated.  Internally, there's only support for\n values whose type is one of the primitive Number types:\n Double, Float, Long,\n Integer, Short, or Byte.\n \n To create a SpinnerNumberModel for the integer\n range zero to one hundred, with\n fifty as the initial value, one could write:\n \n Integer value = Integer.valueOf(50);\n Integer min = Integer.valueOf(0);\n Integer max = Integer.valueOf(100);\n Integer step = Integer.valueOf(1);\n SpinnerNumberModel model = new SpinnerNumberModel(value, min, max, step);\n int fifty = model.getNumber().intValue();\n \n\n Spinners for integers and doubles are common, so special constructors\n for these cases are provided.  For example to create the model in\n the previous example, one could also write:\n \n SpinnerNumberModel model = new SpinnerNumberModel(50, 0, 100, 1);\n \n\n This model inherits a ChangeListener.\n The ChangeListeners are notified\n whenever the model's value, stepSize,\n minimum, or maximum properties changes.", "codes": ["public class SpinnerNumberModel\nextends AbstractSpinnerModel\nimplements Serializable"], "fields": [], "methods": [{"method_name": "setMinimum", "method_sig": "public void setMinimum (Comparable<?> minimum)", "description": "Changes the lower bound for numbers in this sequence.\n If minimum is null,\n then there is no lower bound.
