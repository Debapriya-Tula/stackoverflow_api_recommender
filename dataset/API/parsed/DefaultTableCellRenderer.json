{"name": "Class DefaultTableCellRenderer", "module": "java.desktop", "package": "javax.swing.table", "text": "The standard class for rendering (displaying) individual cells\n in a JTable.\n \nImplementation Note:\n This class inherits from JLabel, a standard component class.\n However JTable employs a unique mechanism for rendering\n its cells and therefore requires some slightly modified behavior\n from its cell renderer.\n The table class defines a single cell renderer and uses it as a\n as a rubber-stamp for rendering all cells in the table;\n it renders the first cell,\n changes the contents of that cell renderer,\n shifts the origin to the new location, re-draws it, and so on.\n The standard JLabel component was not\n designed to be used this way and we want to avoid\n triggering a revalidate each time the\n cell is drawn. This would greatly decrease performance because the\n revalidate message would be\n passed up the hierarchy of the container to determine whether any other\n components would be affected.\n As the renderer is only parented for the lifetime of a painting operation\n we similarly want to avoid the overhead associated with walking the\n hierarchy for painting operations.\n So this class\n overrides the validate, invalidate,\n revalidate, repaint, and\n firePropertyChange methods to be\n no-ops and override the isOpaque method solely to improve\n performance.  If you write your own renderer,\n please keep this performance consideration in mind.\n \nWarning:\n Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with\n future Swing releases. The current serialization support is\n appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running\n the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage\n of all JavaBeans\u2122\n has been added to the java.beans package.\n Please see XMLEncoder.", "codes": ["public class DefaultTableCellRenderer\nextends JLabel\nimplements TableCellRenderer, Serializable"], "fields": [{"field_name": "noFocusBorder", "field_sig": "protected static\u00a0Border noFocusBorder", "description": "A border without focus."}], "methods": [{"method_name": "setForeground", "method_sig": "public void setForeground (Color c)", "description": "Overrides JComponent.setForeground to assign\n the unselected-foreground color to the specified color."}, {"method_name": "setBackground", "method_sig": "public void setBackground (Color c)", "description": "Overrides JComponent.setBackground to assign\n the unselected-background color to the specified color."}, {"method_name": "updateUI", "method_sig": "public void updateUI()", "description": "Notification from the UIManager that the look and feel\n [L&F] has changed.\n Replaces the current UI object with the latest version from the\n UIManager."}, {"method_name": "getTableCellRendererComponent", "method_sig": "public Component getTableCellRendererComponent (JTable table,\n                                               Object value,\n                                               boolean isSelected,\n                                               boolean hasFocus,\n                                               int row,\n                                               int column)", "description": "Returns the default table cell renderer.\n \n During a printing operation, this method will be called with\n isSelected and hasFocus values of\n false to prevent selection and focus from appearing\n in the printed output.
