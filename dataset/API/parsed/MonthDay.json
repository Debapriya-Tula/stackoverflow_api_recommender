{"name": "Class MonthDay", "module": "java.base", "package": "java.time", "text": "A month-day in the ISO-8601 calendar system, such as --12-03.\n \nMonthDay is an immutable date-time object that represents the combination\n of a month and day-of-month.

It is equivalent to the proleptic Gregorian calendar\n system, in which today's rules for leap years are applied for all time.\n For most applications written today, the ISO-8601 rules are entirely suitable.\n However, any application that makes use of historical dates, and requires them\n to be accurate will find the ISO-8601 approach unsuitable.\n\n \n This is a value-based\n class; use of identity-sensitive operations (including reference equality\n (==), identity hash code, or synchronization) on instances of\n MonthDay may have unpredictable results and should be avoided.\n The equals method should be used for comparisons.", "codes": ["public final class MonthDay\nextends Object\nimplements TemporalAccessor, TemporalAdjuster, Comparable<MonthDay>, Serializable"], "fields": [], "methods": [{"method_name": "now", "method_sig": "public static MonthDay now()", "description": "Obtains the current month-day from the system clock in the default time-zone.\n \n This will query the system clock in the default\n time-zone to obtain the current month-day.\n \n Using this method will prevent the ability to use an alternate clock for testing\n because the clock is hard-coded."}, {"method_name": "now", "method_sig": "public static MonthDay now (ZoneId zone)", "description": "Obtains the current month-day from the system clock in the specified time-zone.\n \n This will query the system clock to obtain the current month-day.\n Specifying the time-zone avoids dependence on the default time-zone.\n \n Using this method will prevent the ability to use an alternate clock for testing\n because the clock is hard-coded."}, {"method_name": "now", "method_sig": "public static MonthDay now (Clock clock)", "description": "Obtains the current month-day from the specified clock.\n \n This will query the specified clock to obtain the current month-day.\n Using this method allows the use of an alternate clock for testing.\n The alternate clock may be introduced using dependency injection."}, {"method_name": "of", "method_sig": "public static MonthDay of (Month month,\n                          int dayOfMonth)", "description": "Obtains an instance of MonthDay.\n \n The day-of-month must be valid for the month within a leap year.\n Hence, for February, day 29 is valid.\n \n For example, passing in April and day 31 will throw an exception, as\n there can never be April 31st in any year.
