This style\n sheet comes after the author style sheet in the cascade algorithm and is\n called override style sheet. The override style sheet takes precedence\n over author style sheets. An \"!important\" declaration still takes\n precedence over a normal declaration. Override, author, and user style\n sheets all may contain \"!important\" declarations. User \"!important\" rules\n take precedence over both override and author \"!important\" rules, and\n override \"!important\" rules take precedence over author \"!important\"\n rules.\n  The expectation is that an instance of the DocumentCSS\n interface can be obtained by using binding-specific casting methods on an\n instance of the Document interface.\n See also the Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Style Specification.", "codes": ["public interface DocumentCSS\nextends DocumentStyle"], "fields": [], "methods": [{"method_name": "getOverrideStyle", "method_sig": "CSSStyleDeclaration getOverrideStyle (Element elt,\n                                     String pseudoElt)", "description": "This method is used to retrieve the override style declaration for a\n specified element and a specified pseudo-element."}]}
