AccessibleContext also contains methods for obtaining more\n specific accessibility information about a component. If the component\n supports them, these methods will return an object that implements one or\n more of the following interfaces:\n \nAccessibleAction - the object can perform one or more actions.\n   This interface provides the standard mechanism for an assistive technology\n   to determine what those actions are and tell the object to perform them.\n   Any object that can be manipulated should support this interface.\n   AccessibleComponent - the object has a graphical\n   representation. This interface provides the standard mechanism for an\n   assistive technology to determine and set the graphical representation of\n   the object. Any object that is rendered on the screen should support this\n   interface.\n   AccessibleSelection - the object allows its children to be\n   selected. This interface provides the standard mechanism for an assistive\n   technology to determine the currently selected children of the object as\n   well as modify its selection set. Any object that has children that can be\n   selected should support this interface.\n   AccessibleText - the object presents editable textual\n   information on the display. This interface provides the standard mechanism\n   for an assistive technology to access that text via its content,\n   attributes, and spatial location. Any object that contains editable text\n   should support this interface.\n   AccessibleValue - the object supports a numerical value. This\n   interface provides the standard mechanism for an assistive technology to\n   determine and set the current value of the object, as well as obtain its\n   minimum and maximum values.
