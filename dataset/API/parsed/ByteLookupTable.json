The output of a\n lookup operation using an object of this class is interpreted\n as an unsigned byte quantity.  The lookup table contains byte\n data arrays for one or more bands (or components) of an image,\n and it contains an offset which will be subtracted from the\n input values before indexing the arrays.  This allows an array\n smaller than the native data size to be provided for a\n constrained input.
