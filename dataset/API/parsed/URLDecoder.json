{"name": "Class URLDecoder", "module": "java.base", "package": "java.net", "text": "Utility class for HTML form decoding. This class contains static methods\n for decoding a String from the application/x-www-form-urlencoded\n MIME format.\n \n The conversion process is the reverse of that used by the URLEncoder class. It is assumed\n that all characters in the encoded string are one of the following:\n \"a\" through \"z\",\n \"A\" through \"Z\",\n \"0\" through \"9\", and\n \"-\", \"_\",\n \".\", and \"*\". The\n character \"%\" is allowed but is interpreted\n as the start of a special escaped sequence.\n \n The following rules are applied in the conversion:\n\n \nThe alphanumeric characters \"a\" through\n     \"z\", \"A\" through\n     \"Z\" and \"0\"\n     through \"9\" remain the same.\n The special characters \".\",\n     \"-\", \"*\", and\n     \"_\" remain the same.\n The plus sign \"+\" is converted into a\n     space character \" \u00a0 \" .\n A sequence of the form \"%xy\" will be\n     treated as representing a byte where xy is the two-digit\n     hexadecimal representation of the 8 bits. Then, all substrings\n     that contain one or more of these byte sequences consecutively\n     will be replaced by the character(s) whose encoding would result\n     in those consecutive bytes.\n     The encoding scheme used to decode these characters may be specified,\n     or if unspecified, the default encoding of the platform will be used.\n \n\n There are two possible ways in which this decoder could deal with\n illegal strings.  It could either leave illegal characters alone or\n it could throw an IllegalArgumentException.\n Which approach the decoder takes is left to the\n implementation.", "codes": ["public class URLDecoder\nextends Object"], "fields": [], "methods": [{"method_name": "decode", "method_sig": "@Deprecated\npublic static String decode (String s)", "description": "Decodes a x-www-form-urlencoded string.\n The platform's default encoding is used to determine what characters\n are represented by any consecutive sequences of the form\n \"%xy\"."}, {"method_name": "decode", "method_sig": "public static String decode (String s,\n                            String enc)\n                     throws UnsupportedEncodingException", "description": "Decodes an application/x-www-form-urlencoded string using\n a specific encoding scheme.\n\n \n This method behaves the same as decode(java.lang.String,java.nio.charset.Charset)\n except that it will look up the charset\n using the given encoding name."}, {"method_name": "decode", "method_sig": "public static String decode (String s,\n                            Charset charset)", "description": "Decodes an application/x-www-form-urlencoded string using\n a specific Charset.\n The supplied charset is used to determine\n what characters are represented by any consecutive sequences of the\n form \"%xy\".\n \nNote: The \n World Wide Web Consortium Recommendation states that\n UTF-8 should be used.
