{"name": "Class DragSourceContext", "module": "java.desktop", "package": "java.awt.dnd", "text": "The DragSourceContext class is responsible for managing the\n initiator side of the Drag and Drop protocol. In particular, it is responsible\n for managing drag event notifications to the\n DragSourceListeners\n and DragSourceMotionListeners, and providing the\n Transferable representing the source data for the drag operation.\n \n Note that the DragSourceContext itself\n implements the DragSourceListener and\n DragSourceMotionListener interfaces.\n This is to allow the platform peer\n (the DragSourceContextPeer instance)\n created by the DragSource to notify\n the DragSourceContext of\n state changes in the ongoing operation. This allows the\n DragSourceContext object to interpose\n itself between the platform and the\n listeners provided by the initiator of the drag operation.\n \n\n By default, DragSourceContext sets the cursor as appropriate\n for the current state of the drag and drop operation. For example, if\n the user has chosen the move action,\n and the pointer is over a target that accepts\n the move action, the default move cursor is shown. When\n the pointer is over an area that does not accept the transfer,\n the default \"no drop\" cursor is shown.\n \n This default handling mechanism is disabled when a custom cursor is set\n by the setCursor(java.awt.Cursor) method. When the default handling is disabled,\n it becomes the responsibility\n of the developer to keep the cursor up to date, by listening\n to the DragSource events and calling the setCursor() method.\n Alternatively, you can provide custom cursor behavior by providing\n custom implementations of the DragSource\n and the DragSourceContext classes.", "codes": ["public class DragSourceContext\nextends Object\nimplements DragSourceListener, DragSourceMotionListener, Serializable"], "fields": [{"field_name": "DEFAULT", "field_sig": "protected static final\u00a0int DEFAULT", "description": "An int used by updateCurrentCursor()\n indicating that the Cursor should change\n to the default (no drop) Cursor."}, {"field_name": "ENTER", "field_sig": "protected static final\u00a0int ENTER", "description": "An int used by updateCurrentCursor()\n indicating that the Cursor\n has entered a DropTarget."}, {"field_name": "OVER", "field_sig": "protected static final\u00a0int OVER", "description": "An int used by updateCurrentCursor()\n indicating that the Cursor is\n over a DropTarget."}, {"field_name": "CHANGED", "field_sig": "protected static final\u00a0int CHANGED", "description": "An int used by updateCurrentCursor()\n indicating that the user operation has changed."}], "methods": [{"method_name": "getDragSource", "method_sig": "public DragSource getDragSource()", "description": "Returns the DragSource\n that instantiated this DragSourceContext."}, {"method_name": "getComponent", "method_sig": "public Component getComponent()", "description": "Returns the Component associated with this\n DragSourceContext."}, {"method_name": "getTrigger", "method_sig": "public DragGestureEvent getTrigger()", "description": "Returns the DragGestureEvent\n that initially triggered the drag."}, {"method_name": "getSourceActions", "method_sig": "public int getSourceActions()", "description": "Returns a bitwise mask of DnDConstants that\n represent the set of drop actions supported by the drag source for the\n drag operation associated with this DragSourceContext."}, {"method_name": "setCursor", "method_sig": "public void setCursor (Cursor c)", "description": "Sets the custom cursor for this drag operation to the specified\n Cursor.
