The\n last image in the array will be returned if no suitable image is found\n that is as large as the rendering request.\n \n For best effect the array of images should be sorted with each image being\n both wider and taller than the previous image.  The base image need not be\n the first image in the array. No exception will be thrown if the images\n are not sorted as suggested.", "codes": ["public class BaseMultiResolutionImage\nextends AbstractMultiResolutionImage"], "fields": [], "methods": []}
