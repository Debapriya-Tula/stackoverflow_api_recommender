This interface is included in SAX2 only\n to support legacy SAX1 applications.\nThe order of events in this interface is very important, and\n mirrors the order of information in the document itself.  For\n example, all of an element's content (character data, processing\n instructions, and/or subelements) will appear, in order, between\n the startElement event and the corresponding endElement event.\nApplication writers who do not want to implement the entire\n interface can derive a class from HandlerBase, which implements\n the default functionality; parser writers can instantiate\n HandlerBase to obtain a default handler.
