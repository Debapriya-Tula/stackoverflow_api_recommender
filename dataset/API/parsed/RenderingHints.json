The FRACTIONALMETRICS hint controls whether the positioning\n of individual character glyphs takes into account the sub-pixel\n accuracy of the scaled character advances of the font or whether\n such

whether or\n not the actual rasterization or pixel bounds of the glyph should\n be modified to match.\n \n Rendering text to a low resolution device like a screen will\n necessarily involve a number of rounding operations as the\n high quality and very precise definition of the shape and\n metrics of the character glyphs must be matched to discrete\n device pixels.\n Ideally the positioning of glyphs during text layout would be\n calculated by scaling the design metrics in the font according\n to the point size, but then the scaled advance width will not\n necessarily be an integer number of pixels.\n If the glyphs are positioned with sub-pixel accuracy according\n to these scaled design metrics then the rasterization would\n ideally need to be adjusted for each possible sub-pixel origin.\n \n Unfortunately, scaling each glyph customized to its exact\n subpixel origin during text layout would be prohibitively\n expensive so a simplified system based on integer device\n positions is typically used to lay out the text.\n The rasterization of the glyph and the scaled advance width\n are both adjusted together to yield text that looks good at\n device resolution and has consistent integer pixel distances\n between glyphs that help the glyphs look uniformly and\n consistently spaced and readable.\n \n This process of rounding advance widths for rasterized glyphs\n to integer distances means that the character density and the\n overall length of a string of text will be different from the\n theoretical design measurements due to the accumulation of\n a series of small differences in the adjusted widths of\n each glyph.\n The specific differences will be different for each glyph,\n some being wider and some being narrower than their theoretical\n design measurements.\n Thus the overall difference in character density and length\n will vary by a number of factors including the font, the\n specific device resolution being targeted, and the glyphs\n chosen to represent the string being rendered.\n As a result, rendering the same string at multiple device\n resolutions can yield widely varying metrics for whole strings.\n \n When FRACTIONALMETRICS are enabled, the true font design\n metrics are scaled by the point size and used for layout with\n sub-pixel accuracy.\n The average density of glyphs and total length of a long\n string of characters will therefore more closely match the\n theoretical design of the font, but readability may be affected\n since individual pairs of characters may not always appear to\n be consistent distances apart depending on how the sub-pixel\n accumulation of the glyph origins meshes with the device pixel\n grid.\n Enabling this hint may be desirable when text layout is being\n performed that must be consistent across a wide variety of\n output resolutions.\n Specifically, this hint may be desirable in situations where\n the layout of text is being previewed on a low resolution\n device like a screen for output that will eventually be\n rendered on a high resolution printer or typesetting device.\n \n When disabled, the scaled design metrics are rounded or adjusted\n to integer distances for layout.\n The distances between any specific pair of glyphs will be more\n uniform on the device, but the density and total length of long\n strings may no longer match the theoretical intentions of the\n font designer.\n Disabling this hint will typically produce more readable results\n on low resolution devices like computer monitors.\n \n The allowable values for this key are\n
