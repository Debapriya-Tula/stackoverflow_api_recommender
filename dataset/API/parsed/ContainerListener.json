When the container's contents change because a component\n has been added or removed, the relevant method in the listener object\n is invoked, and the ContainerEvent is passed to it.\n \n Container events are provided for notification purposes ONLY;\n The AWT will automatically handle add and remove operations\n internally so the program works properly regardless of\n whether the program registers a ContainerListener or not.", "codes": ["public interface ContainerListener\nextends EventListener"], "fields": [], "methods": [{"method_name": "componentAdded", "method_sig": "void componentAdded (ContainerEvent e)", "description": "Invoked when a component has been added to the container."}, {"method_name": "componentRemoved", "method_sig": "void componentRemoved (ContainerEvent e)", "description": "Invoked when a component has been removed from the container."}]}
