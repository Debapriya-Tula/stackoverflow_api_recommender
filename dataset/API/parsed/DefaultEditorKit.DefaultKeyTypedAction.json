There is a variation across\n different VM's in what gets sent as a key typed\n event, and this action tries to filter out the undesired\n events.  This filters the control characters and those\n with the ALT modifier.  It allows Control-Alt sequences\n through as these form legitimate unicode characters on\n some PC keyboards.\n \n If the event doesn't get filtered, it will try to insert\n content into the text editor.  The content is fetched\n from the command string of the ActionEvent.  The text\n entry is done through the replaceSelection\n method on the target text component.  This is the\n action that will be fired for most text entry tasks.\n \nWarning:\n Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with\n future Swing releases. The current serialization support is\n appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running\n the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage\n of all JavaBeans\u2122\n has been added to the java.beans package.\n Please see XMLEncoder.", "codes": ["public static class DefaultEditorKit.DefaultKeyTypedAction\nextends TextAction"], "fields": [], "methods": [{"method_name": "actionPerformed", "method_sig": "public void actionPerformed (ActionEvent e)", "description": "The operation to perform when this action is triggered."}]}
