{"name": "Class DatagramSocket", "module": "java.base", "package": "java.net", "text": "This class represents a socket for sending and receiving datagram packets.\n\n A datagram socket is the sending or receiving point for a packet\n delivery service. Each packet sent or received on a datagram socket\n is individually addressed and routed. Multiple packets sent from\n one machine to another may be routed differently, and may arrive in\n any order.\n\n  Where possible, a newly constructed DatagramSocket has the\n SO_BROADCAST socket option enabled so as\n to allow the transmission of broadcast datagrams. In order to receive\n broadcast packets a DatagramSocket should be bound to the wildcard address.\n In some implementations, broadcast packets may also be received when\n a DatagramSocket is bound to a more specific address.\n \n Example:\n \n              DatagramSocket s = new DatagramSocket(null);\n              s.bind(new InetSocketAddress(8888));\n \n Which is equivalent to:\n \n              DatagramSocket s = new DatagramSocket(8888);\n \n Both cases will create a DatagramSocket able to receive broadcasts on\n UDP port 8888.", "codes": ["public class DatagramSocket\nextends Object\nimplements Closeable"], "fields": [], "methods": [{"method_name": "bind", "method_sig": "public void bind (SocketAddress addr)\n          throws SocketException", "description": "Binds this DatagramSocket to a specific address and port.\n \n If the address is null, then the system will pick up\n an ephemeral port and a valid local address to bind the socket."}, {"method_name": "connect", "method_sig": "public void connect (InetAddress address,\n                    int port)", "description": "Connects the socket to a remote address for this socket.

Note, there is no\n guarantee that the exception will be thrown.\n\n  If a security manager has been installed then it is invoked to check\n access to the remote address.
