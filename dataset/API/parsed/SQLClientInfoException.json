In addition to the information provided\n by SQLException, a SQLClientInfoException provides a list of client info\n properties that were not set.\n\n Some databases do not allow multiple client info properties to be set\n atomically.  For those databases, it is possible that some of the client\n info properties had been set even though the Connection.setClientInfo\n method threw an exception.  An application can use the getFailedProperties \n method to retrieve a list of client info properties that were not set.  The\n properties are identified by passing a\n Map<String,ClientInfoStatus> to\n the appropriate SQLClientInfoException constructor.", "codes": ["public class SQLClientInfoException\nextends SQLException"], "fields": [], "methods": [{"method_name": "getFailedProperties", "method_sig": "public Map<String, ClientInfoStatus> getFailedProperties()", "description": "Returns the list of client info properties that could not be set.
