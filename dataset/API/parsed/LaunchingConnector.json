The default argument map for a\n connector can be obtained through Connector.defaultArguments().\n Argument map values can be changed, but map entries should not be\n added or deleted.\n A target VM launched by a launching connector is not\n guaranteed to be stable until after the VMStartEvent has been\n received.\n \nImportant note: If a target VM is launched through this\n funcctions, its output and error streams must be read as it\n executes. These streams are available through the\n Process object returned by\n VirtualMachine.process(). If the streams are not periodically\n read, the target VM will stop executing when the buffers for these\n streams are filled."}]}
