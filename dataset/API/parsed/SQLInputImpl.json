{"name": "Class SQLInputImpl", "module": "java.sql.rowset", "package": "javax.sql.rowset.serial", "text": "An input stream used for custom mapping user-defined types (UDTs).\n An SQLInputImpl object is an input stream that contains a\n stream of values that are the attributes of a UDT.\n \n This class is used by the driver behind the scenes when the method\n getObject is called on an SQL structured or distinct type\n that has a custom mapping; a programmer never invokes\n SQLInputImpl methods directly. They are provided here as a\n convenience for those who write RowSet implementations.\n \n The SQLInputImpl class provides a set of\n reader methods analogous to the ResultSet getter\n methods.  These methods make it possible to read the values in an\n SQLInputImpl object.\n \n The method wasNull is used to determine whether the\n the last value read was SQL NULL.\n When the method getObject is called with an\n object of a class implementing the interface SQLData,\n the JDBC driver calls the method SQLData.getSQLType\n to determine the SQL type of the UDT being custom mapped. The driver\n creates an instance of SQLInputImpl, populating it with the\n attributes of the UDT.  The driver then passes the input\n stream to the method SQLData.readSQL, which in turn\n calls the SQLInputImpl reader methods\n to read the attributes from the input stream.", "codes": ["public class SQLInputImpl\nextends Object\nimplements SQLInput"], "fields": [], "methods": [{"method_name": "readString", "method_sig": "public String readString()\n                  throws SQLException", "description": "Retrieves the next attribute in this SQLInputImpl object as\n a String in the Java programming language.\n \n This method does not perform type-safe checking to determine if the\n returned type is the expected type;
