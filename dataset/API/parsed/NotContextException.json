{"name": "Class NotContextException", "module": "java.naming", "package": "javax.naming", "text": "This exception is thrown when a naming operation proceeds to a point\n where a context is required to continue the operation, but the\n resolved object is not a context. For example, Context.destroy() requires\n that the named object be a context. If it is not, NotContextException\n is thrown. Another example is a non-context being encountered during\n the resolution phase of the Context methods.\n\n It is also thrown when a particular subtype of context is required,\n such as a DirContext, and the resolved object is a context but not of\n the required subtype.\n \n Synchronization and serialization issues that apply to NamingException\n apply directly here.", "codes": ["public class NotContextException\nextends NamingException"], "fields": [], "methods": []}
