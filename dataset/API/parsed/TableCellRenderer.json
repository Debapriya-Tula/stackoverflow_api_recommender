If this renderer cares about rendering\n the DnD drop location, it should query the table directly to\n see if the given row and column represent the drop location:\n \n     JTable.DropLocation dropLocation = table.getDropLocation();\n     if (dropLocation != null\n             && !dropLocation.isInsertRow()\n             && !dropLocation.isInsertColumn()\n             && dropLocation.getRow() == row\n             && dropLocation.getColumn() == column) {\n\n         // this cell represents the current drop location\n         // so render it specially, perhaps with a different color\n     }\n \n\n During a printing operation, this method will be called with\n isSelected and hasFocus values of\n false to prevent selection and focus from appearing\n in the printed output. To do other customization based on whether\n or not the table is being printed, check the return value from\n JComponent.isPaintingForPrint()."}]}
