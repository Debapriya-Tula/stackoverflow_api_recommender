A new abstract annotation\n value visitor class will also be introduced to correspond to the\n new language level; this visitor will have different default\n behavior for the visit method in question.  When the new visitor is\n introduced, all or portions of this visitor may be deprecated.", "codes": ["@SupportedSourceVersion(RELEASE_7)\npublic abstract class AbstractAnnotationValueVisitor7<R, P>\nextends AbstractAnnotationValueVisitor6<R, P>"], "fields": [], "methods": []}
