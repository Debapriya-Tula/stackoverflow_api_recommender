When a key is pressed, released, or typed,\n the relevant method in the listener object is invoked,\n and the KeyEvent is passed to it.", "codes": ["public abstract class KeyAdapter\nextends Object\nimplements KeyListener"], "fields": [], "methods": [{"method_name": "keyTyped", "method_sig": "public void keyTyped (KeyEvent e)", "description": "Invoked when a key has been typed.\n This event occurs when a key press is followed by a key release."}, {"method_name": "keyPressed", "method_sig": "public void keyPressed (KeyEvent e)", "description": "Invoked when a key has been pressed."}, {"method_name": "keyReleased", "method_sig": "public void keyReleased (KeyEvent e)", "description": "Invoked when a key has been released."}]}
