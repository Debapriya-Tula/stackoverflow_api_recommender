Instruments are typically stored in\n collections called soundbanks. Before the instrument can be used to play\n notes, it must first be loaded onto a synthesizer, and then it must be\n selected for use on one or more channels, via a program-change command. MIDI\n notes that are subsequently received on those channels will be played using\n the sound of the selected instrument.", "codes": ["public abstract class Instrument\nextends SoundbankResource"], "fields": [], "methods": [{"method_name": "getPatch", "method_sig": "public Patch getPatch()", "description": "Obtains the Patch object that indicates the bank and program\n numbers where this instrument is to be stored in the synthesizer."}]}
