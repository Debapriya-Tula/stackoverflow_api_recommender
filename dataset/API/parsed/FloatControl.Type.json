A positive gain amplifies\n (boosts) the signal's volume, and a negative gain attenuates(cuts)it.\n The gain setting defaults to a value of 0.0 dB, meaning the signal's\n loudness is unaffected. Note that gain measures dB, not amplitude.\n The relationship between a gain in decibels and the corresponding\n linear amplitude multiplier is:\n \nlinearScalar = pow(10.0, gainDB/20.0)\n\n The FloatControl class has methods to impose a maximum and\n minimum allowable value for gain. However, because an audio signal\n might already be at a high amplitude, the maximum setting does not\n guarantee that the signal will be undistorted when the gain is\n applied to it (unless the maximum is zero or negative). To avoid\n numeric overflow from excessively large gain settings, a gain control\n can implement clipping, meaning that the signal's amplitude will be\n limited to the maximum value representable by its audio format,\n instead of wrapping around.\n \n These comments apply to gain controls in general, not just master\n gain controls. A line can have more than one gain control. For\n example, a mixer (which is itself a line) might have a master gain\n control, an auxiliary return control, a reverb return control, and,\n on each of its source lines, an individual aux send and reverb send."}, {"field_name": "AUX_SEND", "field_sig": "public static final\u00a0FloatControl.Type AUX_SEND", "description": "Represents a control for the auxiliary send gain on a line."}, {"field_name": "AUX_RETURN", "field_sig": "public static final\u00a0FloatControl.Type AUX_RETURN", "description": "Represents a control for the auxiliary return gain on a line."}, {"field_name": "REVERB_SEND", "field_sig": "public static final\u00a0FloatControl.Type REVERB_SEND", "description": "Represents a control for the pre-reverb gain on a line.

For example,\n if the natural rate of the media is 11025 samples per second and the\n sample rate is set to 22050 samples per second, the media will play\n back at twice the normal speed.\n \n Changing the sample rate with this control does not affect the data\n line's audio format.
