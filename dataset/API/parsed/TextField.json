{"name": "Class TextField", "module": "java.desktop", "package": "java.awt", "text": "A TextField object is a text component\n that allows for the editing of a single line of text.\n \n For example, the following image depicts a frame with four\n text fields of varying widths. Two of these text fields\n display the predefined text \"Hello\".\n \n\n\n Here is the code that produces these four text fields:\n\n \n TextField tf1, tf2, tf3, tf4;\n // a blank text field\n tf1 = new TextField();\n // blank field of 20 columns\n tf2 = new TextField(\"\", 20);\n // predefined text displayed\n tf3 = new TextField(\"Hello!\");\n // predefined text in 30 columns\n tf4 = new TextField(\"Hello\", 30);\n \n\n Every time the user types a key in the text field, one or\n more key events are sent to the text field.  A KeyEvent\n may be one of three types: keyPressed, keyReleased, or keyTyped.\n The properties of a key event indicate which of these types\n it is, as well as additional information about the event,\n such as what modifiers are applied to the key event and the\n time at which the event occurred.\n \n The key event is passed to every KeyListener\n or KeyAdapter object which registered to receive such\n events using the component's addKeyListener method.\n (KeyAdapter objects implement the\n KeyListener interface.)\n \n It is also possible to fire an ActionEvent.\n If action events are enabled for the text field, they may\n be fired by pressing the Return key.\n \n The TextField class's processEvent\n method examines the action event and passes it along to\n processActionEvent. The latter method redirects the\n event to any ActionListener objects that have\n registered to receive action events generated by this\n text field.", "codes": ["public class TextField\nextends TextComponent"], "fields": [], "methods": [{"method_name": "addNotify", "method_sig": "public void addNotify()", "description": "Creates the TextField's peer.
