Another example is\n if the provider requires that a URL be specified as one of the\n environment properties but the client failed to provide it.\n \n Synchronization and serialization issues that apply to NamingException\n apply directly here.", "codes": ["public class ConfigurationException\nextends NamingException"], "fields": [], "methods": []}
