{"name": "Class LinkedList<E>", "module": "java.base", "package": "java.util", "text": "Doubly-linked list implementation of the List and Deque\n interfaces.  Implements all optional list operations, and permits all\n elements (including null).\n\n All of the operations perform as could be expected for a doubly-linked\n list.  Operations that index into the list will traverse the list from\n the beginning or the end, whichever is closer to the specified index.\n\n Note that this implementation is not synchronized.\n If multiple threads access a linked list concurrently, and at least\n one of the threads modifies the list structurally, it must be\n synchronized externally.  (A structural modification is any operation\n that adds or deletes one or more elements; merely setting the value of\n an element is not a structural modification.)  This is typically\n accomplished by synchronizing on some object that naturally\n encapsulates the list.\n\n If no such object exists, the list should be \"wrapped\" using the\n Collections.synchronizedList\n method.  This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental\n unsynchronized access to the list:\n   List list = Collections.synchronizedList(new LinkedList(...));\nThe iterators returned by this class's iterator and\n listIterator methods are fail-fast: if the list is\n structurally modified at any time after the iterator is created, in\n any way except through the Iterator's own remove or\n add methods, the iterator will throw a ConcurrentModificationException.  Thus, in the face of concurrent\n modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather than\n risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined\n time in the future.\n\n Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed\n as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the\n presence of unsynchronized concurrent modification.  Fail-fast iterators\n throw ConcurrentModificationException on a best-effort basis.\n Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this\n exception for its correctness:   the fail-fast behavior of iterators\n should be used only to detect bugs.\nThis class is a member of the\n \n Java Collections Framework.", "codes": ["public class LinkedList<E>\nextends AbstractSequentialList<E>\nimplements List<E>, Deque<E>, Cloneable, Serializable"], "fields": [], "methods": [{"method_name": "getFirst", "method_sig": "public E getFirst()", "description": "Returns the first element in this list."}, {"method_name": "getLast", "method_sig": "public E getLast()", "description": "Returns the last element in this list."}, {"method_name": "removeFirst", "method_sig": "public E removeFirst()", "description": "Removes and returns the first element from this list."}, {"method_name": "removeLast", "method_sig": "public E removeLast()", "description": "Removes and returns the last element from this list."}, {"method_name": "addFirst", "method_sig": "public void addFirst (E e)", "description": "Inserts the specified element at the beginning of this list."}, {"method_name": "addLast", "method_sig": "public void addLast (E e)", "description": "Appends the specified element to the end of this list.\n\n This method is equivalent to add(E)."}, {"method_name": "contains", "method_sig": "public boolean contains (Object o)", "description": "Returns true if this list contains the specified element.\n More formally, returns true if and only if this list contains\n at least one element e such that\n Objects.equals(o, e)."}, {"method_name": "size", "method_sig": "public int size()", "description": "Returns the number of elements in this list."}, {"method_name": "add", "method_sig": "public boolean add (E e)", "description": "Appends the specified element to the end of this list.\n\n This method is equivalent to addLast(E)."}, {"method_name": "remove", "method_sig": "public boolean remove (Object o)", "description": "Removes the first occurrence of the specified element from this list,\n if it is present.
