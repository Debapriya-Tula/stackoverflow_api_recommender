{"name": "Class JSplitPane", "module": "java.desktop", "package": "javax.swing", "text": "JSplitPane is used to divide two (and only two)\n Components. The two Components\n are graphically divided based on the look and feel\n implementation, and the two Components can then be\n interactively resized by the user.\n Information on using JSplitPane is in\n How to Use Split Panes in\n The Java Tutorial.\n \n The two Components in a split pane can be aligned\n left to right using\n JSplitPane.HORIZONTAL_SPLIT, or top to bottom using\n JSplitPane.VERTICAL_SPLIT.\n The preferred way to change the size of the Components\n is to invoke\n setDividerLocation where location is either\n the new x or y position, depending on the orientation of the\n JSplitPane.\n \n To resize the Components to their preferred sizes invoke\n resetToPreferredSizes.\n \n When the user is resizing the Components the minimum\n size of the Components is used to determine the\n maximum/minimum position the Components\n can be set to. If the minimum size of the two\n components is greater than the size of the split pane the divider\n will not allow you to resize it. To alter the minimum size of a\n JComponent, see JComponent.setMinimumSize(java.awt.Dimension).\n \n When the user resizes the split pane the new space is distributed between\n the two components based on the resizeWeight property.\n A value of 0,\n the default, indicates the right/bottom component gets all the space,\n where as a value of 1 indicates the left/top component gets all the space.\n \nWarning: Swing is not thread safe. For more\n information see Swing's Threading\n Policy.\n \nWarning:\n Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with\n future Swing releases. The current serialization support is\n appropriate for short term storage or RMI between applications running\n the same version of Swing.  As of 1.4, support for long term storage\n of all JavaBeans\u2122\n has been added to the java.beans package.\n Please see XMLEncoder.", "codes": ["@JavaBean(defaultProperty=\"UI\")\npublic class JSplitPane\nextends JComponent\nimplements Accessible"], "fields": [{"field_name": "VERTICAL_SPLIT", "field_sig": "public static final\u00a0int VERTICAL_SPLIT", "description": "Vertical split indicates the Components are\n split along the y axis.
