{"name": "Class Signature", "module": "java.base", "package": "java.security", "text": "The Signature class is used to provide applications the functionality\n of a digital signature algorithm. Digital signatures are used for\n authentication and integrity assurance of digital data.\n\n  The signature algorithm can be, among others, the NIST standard\n DSA, using DSA and SHA-256. The DSA algorithm using the\n SHA-256 message digest algorithm can be specified as SHA256withDSA.\n In the case of RSA the signing algorithm could be specified as, for example,\n SHA256withRSA.\n The algorithm name must be specified, as there is no default.\n\n  A Signature object can be used to generate and verify digital\n signatures.\n\n  There are three phases to the use of a Signature object for\n either signing data or verifying a signature:\nInitialization, with either\n\n     \na public key, which initializes the signature for\n     verification (see initVerify), or\n\n     a private key (and optionally a Secure Random Number Generator),\n     which initializes the signature for signing\n     (see initSign(PrivateKey)\n     and initSign(PrivateKey, SecureRandom)).\n\n     \nUpdating\n\n Depending on the type of initialization, this will update the\n bytes to be signed or verified. See the\n update methods.\n\n Signing or Verifying a signature on all updated bytes. See the\n sign methods and the verify\n method.\n\n \nNote that this class is abstract and extends from\n SignatureSpi for historical reasons.\n Application developers should only take notice of the methods defined in\n this Signature class; all the methods in\n the superclass are intended for cryptographic service providers who wish to\n supply their own implementations of digital signature algorithms.\n\n  Every implementation of the Java platform is required to support the\n following standard Signature algorithms:\n \nSHA1withDSA\nSHA256withDSA\nSHA1withRSA\nSHA256withRSA\n\n These algorithms are described in the \n Signature section of the\n Java Security Standard Algorithm Names Specification.\n Consult the release documentation for your implementation to see if any\n other algorithms are supported.", "codes": ["public abstract class Signature\nextends SignatureSpi"], "fields": [{"field_name": "UNINITIALIZED", "field_sig": "protected static final\u00a0int UNINITIALIZED", "description": "Possible state value, signifying that\n this signature object has not yet been initialized."}, {"field_name": "SIGN", "field_sig": "protected static final\u00a0int SIGN", "description": "Possible state value, signifying that\n this signature object has been initialized for signing."}, {"field_name": "VERIFY", "field_sig": "protected static final\u00a0int VERIFY", "description": "Possible state value, signifying that\n this signature object has been initialized for verification."}, {"field_name": "state", "field_sig": "protected\u00a0int state", "description": "Current state of this signature object."}], "methods": [{"method_name": "getInstance", "method_sig": "public static Signature getInstance (String algorithm)\n                             throws NoSuchAlgorithmException", "description": "Returns a Signature object that implements the specified signature\n algorithm.\n\n  This method traverses the list of registered security Providers,\n starting with the most preferred Provider.\n A new Signature object encapsulating the\n SignatureSpi implementation from the first\n Provider that supports the specified algorithm is returned.\n\n  Note that the list of registered providers may be retrieved via\n the Security.getProviders() method."}, {"method_name": "getInstance", "method_sig": "public static Signature getInstance (String algorithm,\n                                    String provider)\n                             throws NoSuchAlgorithmException,\n                                    NoSuchProviderException", "description": "Returns a Signature object that implements the specified signature\n algorithm.\n\n  A new Signature object encapsulating the\n SignatureSpi implementation from the specified provider\n is returned.
