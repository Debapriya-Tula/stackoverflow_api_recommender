{"name": "Class ContainerOrderFocusTraversalPolicy", "module": "java.desktop", "package": "java.awt", "text": "A FocusTraversalPolicy that determines traversal order based on the order\n of child Components in a Container. From a particular focus cycle root, the\n policy makes a pre-order traversal of the Component hierarchy, and traverses\n a Container's children according to the ordering of the array returned by\n Container.getComponents(). Portions of the hierarchy that are\n not visible and displayable will not be searched.\n \n By default, ContainerOrderFocusTraversalPolicy implicitly transfers focus\n down-cycle. That is, during normal forward focus traversal, the Component\n traversed after a focus cycle root will be the focus-cycle-root's default\n Component to focus. This behavior can be disabled using the\n setImplicitDownCycleTraversal method.\n \n By default, methods of this class will return a Component only if it is\n visible, displayable, enabled, and focusable. Subclasses can modify this\n behavior by overriding the accept method.\n \n This policy takes into account focus traversal\n policy providers.
