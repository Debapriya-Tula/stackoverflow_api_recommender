Some types of channels,\n depending upon their state, may write only some of the bytes or possibly\n none at all.  A socket channel in non-blocking mode, for example, cannot\n write any more bytes than are free in the socket's output buffer.\n\n  This method may be invoked at any time.  If another thread has\n already initiated a write operation upon this channel, however, then an\n invocation of this method will block until the first operation is\n complete. "}]}
