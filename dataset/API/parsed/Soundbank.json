{"name": "Interface Soundbank", "module": "java.desktop", "package": "javax.sound.midi", "text": "A Soundbank contains a set of Instruments that can be loaded\n into a Synthesizer. Note that a Java Sound Soundbank is\n different from a MIDI bank. MIDI permits up to 16383 banks, each containing\n up to 128 instruments (also sometimes called programs, patches, or timbres).\n However, a Soundbank can contain 16383 times 128 instruments, because\n the instruments within a Soundbank are indexed by both a MIDI program\n number and a MIDI bank number (via a Patch object). Thus, a\n Soundbank can be thought of as a collection of MIDI banks.\n \nSoundbank includes methods that return String objects\n containing the sound bank's name, manufacturer, version number, and\n description. The precise content and format of these strings is left to the\n implementor.\n \n Different synthesizers use a variety of synthesis techniques. A common one is\n wavetable synthesis, in which a segment of recorded sound is played back,\n often with looping and pitch change. The Downloadable Sound (DLS) format uses\n segments of recorded sound, as does the Headspace Engine. Soundbanks\n and Instruments that are based on wavetable synthesis (or other uses\n of stored sound recordings) should typically implement the\n getResources() method to provide access to these recorded segments.\n This is optional, however; the method can return an zero-length array if the\n synthesis technique doesn't use sampled sound (FM synthesis and physical\n modeling are examples of such techniques), or if it does but the implementor\n chooses not to make the samples accessible.", "codes": ["public interface Soundbank"], "fields": [], "methods": [{"method_name": "getName", "method_sig": "String getName()", "description": "Obtains the name of the sound bank."}, {"method_name": "getVersion", "method_sig": "String getVersion()", "description": "Obtains the version string for the sound bank."}, {"method_name": "getVendor", "method_sig": "String getVendor()", "description": "Obtains a string naming the company that provides the sound bank."}, {"method_name": "getDescription", "method_sig": "String getDescription()", "description": "Obtains a textual description of the sound bank, suitable for display."}, {"method_name": "getResources", "method_sig": "SoundbankResource[] getResources()", "description": "Extracts a list of non-Instrument resources contained in the sound bank."}, {"method_name": "getInstruments", "method_sig": "Instrument[] getInstruments()", "description": "Obtains a list of instruments contained in this sound bank."}, {"method_name": "getInstrument", "method_sig": "Instrument getInstrument (Patch patch)", "description": "Obtains an Instrument from the given Patch."}]}
