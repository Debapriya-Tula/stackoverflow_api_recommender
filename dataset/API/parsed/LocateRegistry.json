{"name": "Class LocateRegistry", "module": "java.rmi", "package": "java.rmi.registry", "text": "LocateRegistry is used to obtain a reference to a bootstrap\n remote object registry on a particular host (including the local host), or\n to create a remote object registry that accepts calls on a specific port.\n\n  Note that a getRegistry call does not actually make a\n connection to the remote host.
