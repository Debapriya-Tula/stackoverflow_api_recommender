Class JobStateReason defines standard job state reason\n values. A Print Service implementation only needs to report those job state\n reasons which are appropriate for the particular implementation; it does not\n have to report every defined job state reason.\n \n Instances of JobStateReason do not appear in a Print Job's attribute\n set directly. Rather, a JobStateReasons attribute\n appears in the Print Job's attribute set. The\n JobStateReasons attribute contains zero, one, or more\n than one JobStateReason objects which pertain to the Print Job's\n status. The printer adds a JobStateReason object to the Print Job's\n JobStateReasons attribute when the corresponding\n condition becomes true of the Print Job, and the printer removes the\n JobStateReason object again when the corresponding condition becomes\n false, regardless of whether the Print Job's overall\n JobState also changed.\n \nIPP Compatibility: The category name returned by getName() is\n the IPP attribute name.
