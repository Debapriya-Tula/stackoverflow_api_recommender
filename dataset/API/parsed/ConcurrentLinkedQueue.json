{"name": "Class ConcurrentLinkedQueue<E>", "module": "java.base", "package": "java.util.concurrent", "text": "An unbounded thread-safe queue based on linked nodes.\n This queue orders elements FIFO (first-in-first-out).\n The head of the queue is that element that has been on the\n queue the longest time.\n The tail of the queue is that element that has been on the\n queue the shortest time. New elements\n are inserted at the tail of the queue, and the queue retrieval\n operations obtain elements at the head of the queue.\n A ConcurrentLinkedQueue is an appropriate choice when\n many threads will share access to a common collection.\n Like most other concurrent collection implementations, this class\n does not permit the use of null elements.\n\n This implementation employs an efficient non-blocking\n algorithm based on one described in\n \n Simple, Fast, and Practical Non-Blocking and Blocking Concurrent Queue\n Algorithms by Maged M. Michael and Michael L. Scott.\n\n Iterators are weakly consistent, returning elements\n reflecting the state of the queue at some point at or since the\n creation of the iterator.  They do not throw ConcurrentModificationException, and may proceed concurrently\n with other operations.  Elements contained in the queue since the creation\n of the iterator will be returned exactly once.\n\n Beware that, unlike in most collections, the size method\n is NOT a constant-time operation. Because of the\n asynchronous nature of these queues, determining the current number\n of elements requires a traversal of the elements, and so may report\n inaccurate results if this collection is modified during traversal.\n\n Bulk operations that add, remove, or examine multiple elements,\n such as addAll(java.util.Collection<? extends E>), removeIf(java.util.function.Predicate<? super E>) or forEach(java.util.function.Consumer<? super E>),\n are not guaranteed to be performed atomically.\n For example, a forEach traversal concurrent with an \n addAll operation might observe only some of the added elements.\n\n This class and its iterator implement all of the optional\n methods of the Queue and Iterator interfaces.\n\n Memory consistency effects: As with other concurrent\n collections, actions in a thread prior to placing an object into a\n ConcurrentLinkedQueue\nhappen-before\n actions subsequent to the access or removal of that element from\n the ConcurrentLinkedQueue in another thread.\n\n This class is a member of the\n \n Java Collections Framework.", "codes": ["public class ConcurrentLinkedQueue<E>\nextends AbstractQueue<E>\nimplements Queue<E>, Serializable"], "fields": [], "methods": [{"method_name": "add", "method_sig": "public boolean add (E e)", "description": "Inserts the specified element at the tail of this queue.\n As the queue is unbounded, this method will never throw\n IllegalStateException or return false."}, {"method_name": "offer", "method_sig": "public boolean offer (E e)", "description": "Inserts the specified element at the tail of this queue.\n As the queue is unbounded, this method will never return false."}, {"method_name": "isEmpty", "method_sig": "public boolean isEmpty()", "description": "Returns true if this queue contains no elements."}, {"method_name": "size", "method_sig": "public int size()", "description": "Returns the number of elements in this queue.
