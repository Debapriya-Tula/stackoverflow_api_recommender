{"name": "Class RandomAccessFile", "module": "java.base", "package": "java.io", "text": "Instances of this class support both reading and writing to a\n random access file. A random access file behaves like a large\n array of bytes stored in the file system.

If the random access file is\n created in read/write mode, then output operations are also available;\n output operations write bytes starting at the file pointer and advance\n the file pointer past the bytes written. Output operations that write\n past the current end of the implied array cause the array to be\n extended. The file pointer can be read by the\n getFilePointer method and set by the seek\n method.\n \n It is generally true of all the reading routines in this class that\n if end-of-file is reached before the desired number of bytes has been\n read, an EOFException (which is a kind of\n IOException) is thrown.
