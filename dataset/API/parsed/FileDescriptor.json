This method returns after all modified data and\n attributes of this FileDescriptor have been written to the\n relevant device(s).  In particular, if this FileDescriptor\n refers to a physical storage medium, such as a file in a file\n system, sync will not return until all in-memory modified copies\n of buffers associated with this FileDescriptor have been\n written to the physical medium.\n\n sync is meant to be used by code that requires physical\n storage (such as a file) to be in a known state  For\n example, a class that provided a simple transaction facility\n might use sync to ensure that all changes to a file caused\n by a given transaction were recorded on a storage medium.\n\n sync only affects buffers downstream of this FileDescriptor.  If\n any in-memory buffering is being done by the application (for\n example, by a BufferedOutputStream object), those buffers must\n be flushed into the FileDescriptor (for example, by invoking\n OutputStream.flush) before that data will be affected by sync."}]}
