{"name": "Class JSpinner.DefaultEditor", "module": "java.desktop", "package": "javax.swing", "text": "A simple base class for more specialized editors\n that displays a read-only view of the model's current\n value with a JFormattedTextField.  Subclasses\n can configure the JFormattedTextField to create\n an editor that's appropriate for the type of model they\n support and they may want to override\n the stateChanged and propertyChanged\n methods, which keep the model and the text field in sync.\n \n This class defines a dismiss method that removes the\n editors ChangeListener from the JSpinner\n that it's part of.   The setEditor method knows about\n DefaultEditor.dismiss, so if the developer\n replaces an editor that's derived from JSpinner.DefaultEditor\n its ChangeListener connection back to the\n JSpinner will be removed.  However after that,\n it's up to the developer to manage their editor listeners.\n Similarly, if a subclass overrides createEditor,\n it's up to the subclasser to deal with their editor\n subsequently being replaced (with setEditor).\n We expect that in most cases, and in editor installed\n with setEditor or created by a createEditor\n override, will not be replaced anyway.\n \n This class is the LayoutManager for it's single\n JFormattedTextField child.   By default the\n child is just centered with the parents insets.", "codes": ["public static class JSpinner.DefaultEditor\nextends JPanel\nimplements ChangeListener, PropertyChangeListener, LayoutManager"], "fields": [], "methods": [{"method_name": "dismiss", "method_sig": "public void dismiss (JSpinner spinner)", "description": "Disconnect this editor from the specified\n JSpinner.
