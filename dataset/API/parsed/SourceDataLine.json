{"name": "Interface SourceDataLine", "module": "java.desktop", "package": "javax.sound.sampled", "text": "A source data line is a data line to which data may be written. It acts as a\n source to its mixer. An application writes audio bytes to a source data line,\n which handles the buffering of the bytes and delivers them to the mixer. The\n mixer may mix the samples with those from other sources and then deliver the\n mix to a target such as an output port (which may represent an audio output\n device on a sound card).\n \n Note that the naming convention for this interface reflects the relationship\n between the line and its mixer. From the perspective of an application, a\n source data line may act as a target for audio data.\n \n A source data line can be obtained from a mixer by invoking the\n getLine method of Mixer with an appropriate\n DataLine.Info object.\n \n The SourceDataLine interface provides a method for writing audio data\n to the data line's buffer. Applications that play or mix audio should write\n data to the source data line quickly enough to keep the buffer from\n underflowing (emptying), which could cause discontinuities in the audio that\n are perceived as clicks. Applications can use the\n available method defined in the DataLine\n interface to determine the amount of data currently queued in the data line's\n buffer. The amount of data which can be written to the buffer without\n blocking is the difference between the buffer size and the amount of queued\n data. If the delivery of audio output stops due to underflow, a\n STOP event is generated. A\n START event is generated when the audio output\n resumes.", "codes": ["public interface SourceDataLine\nextends DataLine"], "fields": [], "methods": [{"method_name": "open", "method_sig": "void open (AudioFormat format,\n          int bufferSize)\n   throws LineUnavailableException", "description": "Opens the line with the specified format and suggested buffer size,\n causing the line to acquire any required system resources and become\n operational.\n \n The buffer size is specified in bytes, but must represent an integral\n number of sample frames.
