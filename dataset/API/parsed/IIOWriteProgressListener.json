The\n percentage should ideally be calculated in terms of the\n remaining time to completion, but it is usually more practical\n to use a more well-defined metric such as pixels decoded or\n portion of input stream consumed.

It is not necessary to supply the exact values\n 0 and 100, as these may be inferred\n by the callee from other methods.\n\n  Each particular ImageWriter implementation may\n call this method at whatever frequency it desires.
