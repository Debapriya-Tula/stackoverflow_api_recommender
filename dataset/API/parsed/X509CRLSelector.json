{"name": "Class X509CRLSelector", "module": "java.base", "package": "java.security.cert", "text": "A CRLSelector that selects X509CRLs that\n match all specified criteria. This class is particularly useful when\n selecting CRLs from a CertStore to check revocation status\n of a particular certificate.\n \n When first constructed, an X509CRLSelector has no criteria\n enabled and each of the get methods return a default\n value (null). Therefore, the match method\n would return true for any X509CRL. Typically,\n several criteria are enabled (by calling setIssuers\n or setDateAndTime, for instance) and then the\n X509CRLSelector is passed to\n CertStore.getCRLs or some similar\n method.\n \n Please refer to RFC 5280:\n Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure Certificate and CRL Profile\n for definitions of the X.509 CRL fields and extensions mentioned below.\n \nConcurrent Access\n\n Unless otherwise specified, the methods defined in this class are not\n thread-safe.
