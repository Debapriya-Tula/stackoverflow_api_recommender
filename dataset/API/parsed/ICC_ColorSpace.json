This representation of\n device independent and device dependent color spaces is based on the\n International Color Consortium Specification ICC.1:2001-12, File Format for\n Color Profiles (see http://www.color.org).\n \n Typically, a Color or ColorModel would be associated with an ICC\n Profile which is either an input, display, or output profile (see\n the ICC specification).  There are other types of ICC Profiles, e.g.\n abstract profiles, device link profiles, and named color profiles,\n which do not contain information appropriate for representing the color\n space of a color, image, or device (see ICC_Profile).\n Attempting to create an ICC_ColorSpace object from an inappropriate ICC\n Profile is an error.\n \n ICC Profiles represent transformations from the color space of\n the profile (e.g. a monitor) to a Profile Connection Space (PCS).\n Profiles of interest for tagging images or colors have a\n PCS which is one of the device independent\n spaces (one CIEXYZ space and two CIELab spaces) defined in the\n ICC Profile Format Specification.  Most profiles of interest\n either have invertible transformations or explicitly specify\n transformations going both directions.  Should an ICC_ColorSpace\n object be used in a way requiring a conversion from PCS to\n the profile's native space and there is inadequate data to\n correctly perform the conversion, the ICC_ColorSpace object will\n produce output in the specified type of color space (e.g. TYPE_RGB,\n TYPE_CMYK, etc.), but the specific color values of the output data\n will be undefined.\n \n The details of this class are not important for simple applets,\n which draw in a default color space or manipulate and display\n imported images with a known color space.  At most, such applets\n would need to get one of the default color spaces via\n ColorSpace.getInstance().", "codes": ["public class ICC_ColorSpace\nextends ColorSpace"], "fields": [], "methods": [{"method_name": "getProfile", "method_sig": "public ICC_Profile getProfile()", "description": "Returns the ICC_Profile for this ICC_ColorSpace."}, {"method_name": "toRGB", "method_sig": "public float[] toRGB (float[] colorvalue)", "description": "Transforms a color value assumed to be in this ColorSpace\n into a value in the default CS_sRGB color space.\n \n This method transforms color values using algorithms designed\n to produce the best perceptual match between input and output\n colors.

This\n representation is not the same as the XYZ values that would\n be measured from the given color value by a colorimeter.\n A further transformation is necessary to compute the XYZ values\n that would be measured using current CIE recommended practices.\n The paragraphs below explain this in more detail.\n \n The ICC standard uses a device independent color space (DICS) as the\n mechanism for converting color from one device to another device.  In\n this architecture, colors are converted from the source device's color\n space to the ICC DICS and then from the ICC DICS to the destination\n device's color space.  The ICC standard defines device profiles which\n contain transforms which will convert between a device's color space\n and the ICC DICS.

This is also the color space represented by\n ColorSpace.CS_CIEXYZ.\n \n The XYZ values of a color are often represented as relative to some\n white point, so the actual meaning of the XYZ values cannot be known\n without knowing the white point of those values.  This is known as\n relative colorimetry.  The PCS uses a white point of D50, so the XYZ\n values of the PCS are relative to D50.  For example, white in the PCS\n will have the XYZ values of D50, which is defined to be X=.9642,\n Y=1.000, and Z=0.8249.
